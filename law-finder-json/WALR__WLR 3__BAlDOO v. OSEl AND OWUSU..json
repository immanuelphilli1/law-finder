  "caseTitle": "BA VERSUS OSE",
  "summary": "In Baldoo v. Osei and Owusu, the plaintiff, a subject of the New Juaben Stool, claimed title to stool land based on being the first to cultivate it from virgin forest, thereby acquiring a determinable estate under native custom. The first defendant, a stool stranger, claimed under a 1932 sale from the second defendant (also a stool subject) and a 1948 confirmatory lease from the stool. The High Court upheld the Native Court's finding that the plaintiff's predecessor had cultivated the land first, thus acquiring prior usufructuary rights. The court held that the stool could not validly grant a lease over land already under a subject's usufruct without that subject's consent. The confirmatory lease was therefore void. Additionally, the court found no estoppel by laches, as the plaintiff's family had acted promptly upon discovering the trespass and the defendant's occupation was intermittent. The appeal was dismissed, affirming the plaintiff's title and award of damages for trespass.",
