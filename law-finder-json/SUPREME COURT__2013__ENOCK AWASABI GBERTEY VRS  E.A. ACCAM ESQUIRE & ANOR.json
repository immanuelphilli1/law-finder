  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision in *Enock Awasabi Gbertey v. E.A. Accam Esquire & Anor.* (Civil Appeal No. J4/4/2011, 10th April 2013) concerns the legal consequences of enforcing a judgment later declared a nullity. The Defendant, a lawyer, obtained a judgment for legal fees in 2005, leading to the seizure and auction of the Plaintiff's vehicle in 2006. The Plaintiff failed to comply with a High Court order to deposit GHS 10,000 to stay execution. However, the Court of Appeal later set aside the original judgment in 2007, ruling it a nullity due to the Defendant’s failure to comply with section 30 of the Legal Profession Act, which requires a one-month notice before suing for fees. The Plaintiff then sued to recover his vehicle, but the High Court dismissed the suit, citing abuse of process and obedience to prior court orders. The Court of Appeal reversed this, holding that all processes based on a void judgment—including the seizure and sale—are themselves void ab initio. The Supreme Court affirmed this, dismissing the Defendant’s appeal. It emphasized that a void judgment cannot validate any subsequent enforcement action, and the Plaintiff’s recovery action was lawful. The case reaffirms strict compliance with statutory preconditions in legal practice and the doctrine that 'void' acts are incurably invalid.",
