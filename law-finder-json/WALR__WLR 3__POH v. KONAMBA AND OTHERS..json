  "caseTitle": "POH VERSUS KONAMBA",
  "summary": "In POH v. Konamba and Others, the plaintiff challenged the appointment of the third defendant as successor to Kweku Nte, an intestate deceased, asserting her own rightful claim under customary law. The dispute centered on which family branch had adopted Yaah Boyow, the foundling ancestor of Kweku Nte, with the plaintiff claiming adoption into her lineage through her grandmother Abanja, while the defendants claimed discovery by their relative Sintiwaah. The trial Native Court ruled for the plaintiff, finding her version credible, particularly due to the first defendant's prior admission that Kweku Nte was not from her direct family line. On appeal, the magistrate reversed this, but the High Court restored the original judgment, holding that traditional hearsay evidence is admissible only if given by family members, that adoption assimilates a person fully into the family, and that familial appointments of successors cannot arbitrarily displace rightful heirs. Since the plaintiff was not shown to be unfit and no justification was given for her exclusion, the court declared her the rightful successor.",
