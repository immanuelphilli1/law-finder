  "summary": "The provided document is not a judicial decision but a statutory citator listing amendments, repeals, and substitutions to various Ghanaian laws, ordinances, acts, and decrees between 1940 and 1994. It details legislative changes made primarily through subsequent enactments such as PNDCLs, Acts, and LIs, covering areas including pensions, corporations, criminal law, health, elections, and taxation. No case analysis, court reasoning, or judicial verdict is present, as the content serves as a reference tool for tracking statutory developments in Ghanaian law.",
