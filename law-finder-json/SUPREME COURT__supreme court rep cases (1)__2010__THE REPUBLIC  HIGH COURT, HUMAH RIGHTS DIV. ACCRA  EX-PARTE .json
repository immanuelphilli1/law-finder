  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC HIGH COURT, HUMAH RIGHTS DIV. ACCRA EX-PARTE",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana ruling addressed an application for certiorari to quash a High Court decision allowing the government to take possession of the Mancell Vocational Institute. The applicant, Josephine Akita, administratrix of her deceased mother's estate (one of five beneficiaries of the Institute), challenged the sale, claiming lack of consent. After appealing the dismissal of her injunction and main claim, she sought to restrain enforcement pending appeal. The High Court proceeded to grant possession to the government despite service of Form 6, which signifies transmission of the appeal record. The Supreme Court held that service of Form 6 automatically transferred jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal, rendering the High Court's subsequent actions null. However, the application failed because the applicant had not appealed the specific order granting possession; her grounds only challenged the dismissal of the injunction and the main claim. The Court emphasized strict compliance with procedural rules requiring specificity in appeals. While acknowledging the jurisdictional error, the Court found no breach of audi alteram partem as the applicant boycotted the hearing. It also considered substantial justice, noting the significant public funds involved and the potential for monetary restitution if the applicant ultimately prevails, thus dismissing the application.",
