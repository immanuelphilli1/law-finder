  "summary": "In Kuma and Another v. Kofi and Others, the Supreme Court of the Gold Coast (Land Court, Accra) allowed an appeal against a Native Appeal Court decision that had denied the plaintiffs' claim to redeem land allegedly pledged to the defendants. The trial Native Court had found in favor of the plaintiffs, accepting evidence of a pledge and admissions by the defendant's predecessor that the dispute concerned the redemption amount (a keg of gunpowder), not the nature of the transaction. The Native Appeal Court reversed this, citing failure to perform a customary notification upon the death of a pledgee. Lingley J. held that under native law and custom, a pledge remains redeemable indefinitely and that lapse of time is no bar. He further ruled that while customary notification serves to keep a pledge 'alive,' its absence cannot invalidate a pledge proven by other credible evidence, such as admissions. The appeal was allowed, the Native Appeal Court's judgment was set aside, and the trial court's decision was restored.",
