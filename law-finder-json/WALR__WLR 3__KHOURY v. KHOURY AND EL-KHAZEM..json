  "caseTitle": "KHOURY VERSUS KHOURY",
  "summary": "In Khoury v. Khoury and El-Khazem, the Ghana High Court addressed whether it could entertain a petition for judicial separation when a final decree had already been issued by the courts of Lebanon, the domicile of the parties. The petitioner, resident in Ghana, sought judicial separation and maintenance, relying on local residence as a basis for jurisdiction. However, the respondent challenged the court's jurisdiction, citing a prior Lebanese decree of judicial separation, which remained subject to an appeal on annulment grounds before the Sacra Romana Court of Rome. An expert in Lebanese matrimonial law confirmed that the Lebanese courts had issued a final decree of judicial separation. The court, applying English conflict of laws principles, held that a foreign decree of judicial separation from the country of domicile is recognized as valid and final, even if an appeal on related matters (such as annulment) is pending. The court emphasized that finality depends on whether the pronouncing court has disposed of the issue, not on the possibility of reversal on appeal. Consequently, the Ghanaian court lacked jurisdiction to hear a fresh petition for the same relief. The petition was dismissed, and the interim maintenance order was discharged.",
