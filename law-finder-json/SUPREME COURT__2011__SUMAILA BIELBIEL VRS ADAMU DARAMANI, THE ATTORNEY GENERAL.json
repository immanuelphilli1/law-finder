  "summary": "In Sumaila Bielbiel v. Adamu Daramani & the Attorney General (Review Motion No. J1/2/2010, 26th October 2011), the Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed an application to review its earlier ruling that allowed a constitutional action to proceed under its original jurisdiction. The case centered on whether Adamu Daramani, a Member of Parliament holding a British passport, was disqualified from office under Article 97(1)(e) of the 1992 Constitution for owing allegiance to a foreign country. Initially, the High Court and Court of Appeal dismissed the claim, treating it as a time-barred election petition. However, the Supreme Court held that the matter was a constitutional enforcement action, not an election petition, and thus properly fell within its exclusive original jurisdiction under Article 130(1). The applicant sought review, arguing the decision was per incuriam and created a dangerous precedent. The Court rejected this, emphasizing that review is not a second appeal and that no miscarriage of justice occurred. It affirmed its duty to uphold constitutional supremacy, even if the result affects parliamentary membership.",
