  "caseTitle": "COMMERCIAL BANK PENSIONERS ASSOCIATION v. GHANA",
  "summary": "The Court of Appeal of Ghana dismissed an appeal by Ghana Commercial Bank against a ruling on review, having granted the Pensioners Association's application to strike out the appeal. The bank had attempted to raise an 'internal mechanism' as a basis for appeal, but the court found this argument was not pleaded in the original defence, violating Order 19 Rule 4 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1954. The court held that the issue was an afterthought and could not be raised after the bank had voluntarily submitted to judgment in 1999, citing *Gwira v. State Insurance Corporation* [1991] 1 GLR.398. The court also rejected the bank's claim that delay required special leave for review, noting Rule 34 of CI 19 imposes no time limit—only a requirement of exceptional circumstances and justice. The appeal was struck out for lacking merit, and the bank was ordered to pay �30 million in costs.",
