  "summary": "This appeal arose from a civil suit in which the Gomoa Rural Bank sought to recover a loan of ₵2 million advanced to the deceased, Joseph Kweku Gyesi, secured by a simple equitable pledge of three vehicles. After the cheque deposited by Gyesi was dishonoured, the bank claimed he became indebted. The trial court found in favour of the bank, dismissing the defendants' counter-claim for damages and recovery of one of the pledged vehicles (GN 4625), which had been detained for eight months. The defendants, administrators of the estate, appealed, challenging the authenticity of the pledge document and the lawfulness of the vehicle's seizure. The Court of Appeal upheld the decision, finding that the trial judge correctly relied on witness testimony confirming the deceased’s acknowledgment of the debt and execution of the pledge. The court rejected the handwriting expert’s testimony as unreliable and found no evidence of unlawful arrest or assault. It also ruled that the proposed amendment to the defense failed due to lack of formal court ruling. The appeal was dismissed, affirming the High Court’s judgment.",
