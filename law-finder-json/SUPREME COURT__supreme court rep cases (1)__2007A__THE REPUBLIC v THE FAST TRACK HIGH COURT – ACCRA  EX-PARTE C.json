  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC VRS THE FAST TRACK HIGH COURT",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana interpreted the term 'complaint' under Article 218(a) of the 1992 Constitution, determining that for the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) to initiate an investigation into violations of fundamental rights, corruption, abuse of power, or unfair treatment by public officers, the complaint must be made by an identifiable individual or corporate body and formally lodged with CHRAJ. The Court rejected the notion that public expressions of dissatisfaction, such as media reports, constitute valid complaints under this provision. Relying on a literal and constitutional interpretation, and reading Article 218(a) together with Article 230 and C.I. 7, the Court emphasized that formal procedures require a traceable complainant. The decision clarifies that while CHRAJ has broad investigative functions, its authority under Article 218(a) is triggered only by formal, identifiable complaints, distinguishing it from the investigative mandate under Article 218(e), which does not require such procedural formalities.",
