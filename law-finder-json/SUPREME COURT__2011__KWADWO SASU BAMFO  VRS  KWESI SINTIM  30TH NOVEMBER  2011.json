  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision delivered on 30th November 2011 in the case of Kwadwo Sasu Bamfo v Kwesi Sintim centered on a land ownership dispute between two private parties. The plaintiff claimed ownership of a parcel of land based primarily on oral testimony and alleged inheritance. The defendant countered with evidence of long-standing possession and use. The court found that the plaintiff failed to discharge the burden of proof required to establish valid title under customary law. Emphasizing the need for credible and convincing evidence in land matters, the court ruled in favor of the defendant, affirming that prolonged undisturbed possession can be a strong indicator of ownership in the absence of documentary title. The judgment reaffirmed settled principles of customary land law in Ghana.",
