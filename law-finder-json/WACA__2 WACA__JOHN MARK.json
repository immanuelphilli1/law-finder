  "summary": "This 1934 West African Court of Appeal decision addressed whether a plaintiff could pursue a civil action for assault and battery after the defendant was criminally convicted and ordered to pay compensation under section 74(2) of the Criminal Code, which the plaintiff refused. The court held that section 75 of the Criminal Code barred the civil action because the plaintiff had been given the opportunity to receive compensation, even though he did not accept it. The court interpreted 'receives compensation' broadly to include the judicial award and availability of funds, not just physical receipt. The ruling emphasized legislative intent to prevent multiple proceedings and protect defendants from harassment, aligning with the penal nature of the provisions. The appeal was allowed, affirming the bar on the civil claim.",
