  "caseTitle": "T. R. A. NEWTON",
  "summary": "This is a civil appeal before the West Africa Court of Appeal, Accra, from a Divisional Court judgment in favor of the defendant, J. Laud Apponsah, in a land trespass case. The plaintiff, T. R. A. Newton, claimed damages for the defendant building on his land at Agona Swedru. The Court held that the burden of proof lay with the plaintiff, who failed to prove that the defendant encroached on his property. A consent order referring the matter to a Provincial Surveyor was not binding because the surveyor could not make a definite finding on encroachment. The surveyor's report noted only a 'considerable similarity' between areas when one plan was rotated, which was insufficient to establish identity. The plaintiff's conveyance was found unreliable for fixing boundaries, and his evidence of user and occupation was minimal and contradicted by Abba Assaniwah, whom the trial judge credited. The appellate court found no error in the reception of evidence or in law, and concluded the appeal was without merit.",
