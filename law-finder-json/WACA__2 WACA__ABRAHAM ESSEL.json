  "caseTitle": "ABRAHAM ESSEL",
  "summary": "This Privy Council appeal from the Gold Coast Colony concerns a dispute over title to the Agissu lands. The appellant, Abraham Essel, acted as caretaker for Charles Barnes Acquah, who acquired the land in 1881 via a sheriff's sale following a judgment against Abina Owoodoowa, and later devised it to his daughter, Sarah Quagrainie. The respondent, Rebecca Davis, claimed ownership based on a 1893 certificate of purchase allegedly transferring Abina's interest. The Privy Council held that the 1881 title was valid and consistent with Acquah's long-standing possession and successful trespass actions, while the 1893 certificate lacked credibility due to absence of evidence that Abina retained any interest, failure of Davis to testify, and the likelihood that the 1893 transaction was a nominal purchase by Acquah through his niece as nominee. The Council set aside the Supreme Court's judgment in favor of Davis and restored the Provincial Commissioner's dismissal of her claim.",
