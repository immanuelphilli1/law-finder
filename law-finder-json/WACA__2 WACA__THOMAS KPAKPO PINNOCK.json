  "caseTitle": "THOMAS KPAKPO PINNOCK",
  "summary": "The West Africa Court of Appeal allowed the appeal by Thomas Kpakpo Pinnock against G.B. Ollivant & Co., Ltd., holding that the sale of his mortgaged property at Nsawam was wrongful. The mortgagee had issued a demand notice in 1927 for �75 14s., but did not exercise the power of sale until over six years later, accepting partial payments in the interim without issuing a fresh notice. The property was sold by private treaty through a licensed auctioneer to his own client for �40—less than one-third of its �140 market value as confirmed by the defendants' expert. The court emphasized that as a surety-mortgagor, Pinnock was entitled to notice of the actual outstanding amount before sale, which he never received. The sale was deemed unconscionable and inequitable. The appeal was allowed on the alternative claim for damages, with the case remitted to determine the exact balance due and award the difference between that sum and the market value.",
