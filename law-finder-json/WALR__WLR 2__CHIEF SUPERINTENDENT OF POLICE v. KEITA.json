  "caseTitle": "FISCIAN VERSUS TETTER",
  "summary": "In Fiscian v. Tetteh, the plaintiff (Fiscian, head of the Aruna family) sought a declaration of title to land previously adjudicated in a prior suit where the defendant (Tetteh) had successfully obtained title against Anna Tetteh, who had purchased the land from the Aruna family. The Aruna family refunded the purchase price to Anna Tetteh and attempted to re-litigate the title. The court held that because the family's title had been put in issue through their grantee's litigation and a final judgment was rendered against her, they were estopped from denying the defendant's title. The court emphasized that refunding the purchase price did not restore the right to re-litigate. Additionally, it was held that under native customary law, the right to grant title to portions of 'Brazilian' lands in Accra belongs to the constituent family in occupation of that area, and that the original grant from the Ga Chiefs vested collective title in the Brazilian community, with individual possessory rights arising through cultivation or permission.",
