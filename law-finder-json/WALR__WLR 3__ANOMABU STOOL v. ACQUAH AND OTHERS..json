  "summary": "The case of Anomabu Stool v. Acquah and Others, decided by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on December 2, 1957, concerned a land dispute between two traditional stools in Ghana over ownership and attachment of land in Abonu. The plaintiff, the Anomabu Stool, claimed title and an injunction against the defendants, who were natives under the Asebu Stool. The courts below found in favor of the plaintiff, relying partly on evidence of allegiance by the occupants to the Anomabu Stool. The defendants appealed, arguing that allegiance was a personal matter insufficient to prove land ownership and that the issue was a constitutional matter outside the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. The Privy Council held that the real issue was land ownership, not constitutional relations, and that evidence of allegiance was relevant and could be sufficient in the absence of other evidence. It further ruled that questions of allegiance are not per se constitutional matters. The appeal was dismissed, affirming the lower courts' decisions.",
