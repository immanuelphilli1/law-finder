  "summary": "The case involves a dispute over possession of premises housing the Pan Africa Hotel and associated mesne profits. The plaintiffs won at the High Court in 2006, but the defendant appealed and obtained a partial stay of execution from the Court of Appeal in 2008, conditional on paying half the judgment debt by May 15, 2008. Despite incomplete and delayed payments, the Court of Appeal dismissed the plaintiffs' 2009 application for leave to execute the judgment, citing substantial payments made. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing the Court of Appeal erred in denying execution. The Supreme Court held that the decision was interlocutory, and since the appeal was filed beyond the 21-day statutory limit, it lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal, which was therefore dismissed.",
