  "caseTitle": "CHIEF KWEKU ASSAMPONG",
  "summary": "This 1932 West African Court of Appeal decision in Chief Kwaku Assampong v. Kwaku Amuaku and Others addressed a land trespass dispute in colonial Ghana, focusing on whether an unrecorded, 35-year-old native customary tribunal decision could constitute res judicata. The lower court had rejected the plea of estoppel by res judicata, but the appellate court reversed, holding that the decision—rendered by a joint tribunal appointed by two Paramount Chiefs under native custom—was a valid judicial determination. The tribunal, though not a formal court or arbitrator under English law, exercised judicial functions under local custom and was authorized to resolve inter-state land disputes. The court emphasized that res judicata applies to decisions by bodies exercising judicial authority under native law, even without written records or formal procedures. The appeal succeeded on the res judicata ground, overturning the lower court's judgment and recognizing the binding effect of the ancestral decision in favor of the defendant's predecessor.",
