  "summary": "This article by Hon. Mr. Justice N.Y.B. Adade, a Justice of the Supreme Court of Ghana, examines the philosophical foundations and practical challenges of the 1992 Constitution, emphasizing its lineage from the 1969 and 1979 Constitutions. The author highlights the intent to diffuse executive power and prevent authoritarianism following the collapse of previous democratic experiments. The Constitution is affirmed as the supreme law under Article 1(2), with all other laws subject to its provisions. Article 2 empowers individuals to challenge unconstitutional acts in the Supreme Court, though public awareness and judicial enforcement remain critical. The piece calls for greater civic and legal education, particularly regarding human rights protections, and urges the legal profession to proactively safeguard constitutional rights in everyday contexts such as police conduct, press freedom, fair trial rights, and access to information.",
