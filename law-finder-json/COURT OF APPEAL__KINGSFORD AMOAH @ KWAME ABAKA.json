  "caseTitle": "KINGSFORD AMOAH @ KWAME ABAKA",
  "summary": "Kingsford Amoah alias Kwame Abaka appealed his conviction and 40-year sentence for conspiracy to commit robbery and robbery under sections 23(1) and 149 of the Criminal Offences Act, Act 29, as amended by Act 646. He was jointly tried with Yaw Duodu for the 2007 robbery and murder of a taxi driver, Kwame Takyi, whom they lured into the bush near Mando, stabbed, stole his taxi (GW 7537X) and GH\u000212,000, and fled to Accra. The appeal, based solely on the ground that the judgment was against the weight of evidence, was dismissed. The Court of Appeal found the prosecution proved conspiracy and robbery beyond reasonable doubt through credible, corroborated testimony from multiple witnesses, including eyewitness accounts and police evidence. The appellant's alibi was rejected as implausible. The court affirmed the trial court's findings, noting that the use of knives as offensive weapons justified the enhanced sentence under Act 646.",
