  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision in Madam Nafisa Iddrisu v. Norga Grumah (Civil Appeal No. J4/21/2012, 24th May 2013) centers on a land dispute arising from a failed property transaction. The appellant, Norga Grumah, had his land (No. G20, Sabonjida, Tamale) compulsorily acquired by the State in 1994 for road construction, receiving full compensation. He later sold the unutilized portion to the respondent, Madam Nafisa Iddrisu, who paid GH\u000400.00. The Lands Commission invalidated the sale, asserting state ownership under the principle of nemo dat quod non habet. The respondent then obtained a lease from the Commission, but the appellant refused to vacate. Litigation ensued. The Supreme Court upheld concurrent lower court findings that the land was part of the compulsorily acquired property, vested in the State. It held that the original owner has only a contingent right to re-acquire unused land under Article 20(6) of the 1992 Constitution, which does not confer absolute title or power to convey. The Court of Appeal’s order compelling the appellant to assign the property to the respondent was overturned as legally flawed and risking unjust enrichment, especially since the respondent had already been compensated monetarily. The Supreme Court emphasized that until constitutional conditions for re-acquisition are met, neither the original owner nor the State holds absolute title, and no valid conveyance can occur.",
