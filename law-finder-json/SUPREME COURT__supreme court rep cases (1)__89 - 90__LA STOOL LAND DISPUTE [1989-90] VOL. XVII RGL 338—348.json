  "caseTitle": "Nartey v Mechanical Lloyd Assembly",
  "summary": "The case Nartey v Mechanical Lloyd Assembly Plant Ltd involved a dispute over La rural land in Frafraha, Ghana, where the plaintiff claimed title based on a 1976 grant from Nii Okpoti Adjaye Komey (OK), head of the Agbawe family and Mantse of Frafraha. The central issue was whether OK, as a sub-stool authority, had the power to grant La rural land, or if such authority rested solely with the La stool. While prior authorities suggested the La stool held exclusive granting rights, evidence showed a long-standing practice of sub-stools making grants without objection from the La stool. The Supreme Court was divided: Taylor and Wuaku JJSC applied estoppel by acquiescence, holding the La stool was estopped from denying the validity of sub-stool grants due to prolonged inaction; Adade JSC held sub-stools generally had such power; and two dissenting judges held only the La stool could grant. On the burden of proof, the majority applied a hybrid approach—requiring the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case on the strength of his own title, then weighing both parties' weaknesses. The plaintiff succeeded based on prior possession and defects in the defendant’s title, including lack of clear succession from a lease to Mr. Darko and inconsistency between competing grants.",
