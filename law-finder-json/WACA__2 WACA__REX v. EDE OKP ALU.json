  "caseTitle": "REX v. EDE OKP ALU",
  "summary": "The case involves the appeal of Udu Nwozi, convicted of murder alongside Ede Okp Alu in the Enugu High Court. The Officer Administering the Government referred the conviction of Udu Nwozi to the West African Court of Appeal under section 22 of the West African Court of Appeal Ordinance, 1933. Although Udu Nwozi did not appear or contest the appeal, the Crown Counsel assisted the court by presenting potential arguments in his favor. The appeal raised three key issues: (a) whether the appellant was the actual killer, (b) the admission of inadmissible hearsay evidence, and (c) a misdirection in law by the trial judge. The court held that even though the appellant was not proven to have delivered the fatal blow, and despite the erroneous admission of some hearsay evidence, there was ample credible evidence to sustain the conviction. Crucially, the trial judge failed to invoke section 7(d) of the Nigerian Criminal Code, which holds persons guilty who counsel or procure the commission of a crime. However, the appellate court found that the facts clearly supported such a finding, and thus the misdirection did not result in a miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, under the proviso to section 10(1) of the Ordinance, the conviction was upheld.",
