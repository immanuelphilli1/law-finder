  "caseTitle": "W. B. HAMILTON",
  "summary": "The West Africa Court of Appeal allowed the appeal of W. B. Hamilton against Kofi Mensah, reversing a non-suit judgment in a civil claim for damages due to the wrongful cutting of 103 standing mahogany trees. The appellant argued an oral sale supported by a receipt (Exhibit C) from the defendant's predecessor, which detailed the transaction, including parties, consideration, property description, and signature. The trial judge had applied English law and held the Statute of Frauds unmet due to lack of a written agreement. The appellate court found Exhibit C, if genuine, constituted a sufficient memorandum under section 4 of the Statute of Frauds, satisfying all essential elements. It rejected the notion that the transaction required compliance with the Concessions Ordinance, as the receipt was evidence of a completed sale, not a concession. The court emphasized that the applicability of native law versus English law should be determined at trial based on full evidence, and dismissed the trial judge's skepticism about damages, delay, and partial payment as insufficient grounds to deny legal remedies. The case was remitted for a new trial before a different judge.",
