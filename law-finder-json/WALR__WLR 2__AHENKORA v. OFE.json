  "caseTitle": "AHENKORA VERSUS OFE.",
  "summary": "The applicant, Ahenkora, challenged the Governor's confirmation of a committee of enquiry's recommendation to re-enstool a previously destooled chief. The committee had been appointed under s. 8(1) of the State Councils (Colony and Southern Togoland) Ordinance, c. 8 of 1952, to investigate charges against Ahenkora that could justify his destoolment. However, the committee exceeded its terms of reference by recommending the re-enstoolment of the former chief—a matter not within its mandate. The Supreme Court held that the Governor's powers under the Ordinance are limited to intervening in pending disputes and do not permit overturning completed decisions. Furthermore, the committee was bound by its terms of reference, and both the committee and the Governor acted ultra vires by making and confirming a recommendation outside their jurisdiction. The court granted certiorari to quash the proceedings and the Governor's confirmation, affirming the court's supervisory role over statutory tribunals.",
