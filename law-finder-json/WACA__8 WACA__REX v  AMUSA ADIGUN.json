  "summary": "In Rex v Amusa Adigun and another, the West Africa Court of Appeal heard an appeal against convictions from the High Court. The appellants, Okon Ekpenyong Phillip and Henry Iguma Oshodi, were charged with multiple counts, including count 14: conspiracy to commit a felony under section 516 of the Criminal Code. The court upheld the convictions on all counts except count 14, which it found defective due to uncertainty. The charge failed to specify the nature of the felony allegedly conspired, depriving the accused of adequate notice. The court held that such notice is essential for a fair defense. Consequently, the appeal against conviction on count 14 was allowed, the convictions and sentences on that count were quashed, and judgments of acquittal were entered. The decision underscores the importance of precision in criminal charges, particularly in conspiracy cases.",
