  "caseTitle": "REX v EGBE IBOKO ALO",
  "summary": "In Rex v Egbe Iboko Alo, the appellant was initially convicted of murder after killing the deceased in a fight that followed a sudden quarrel and nighttime challenge. The West Africa Court of Appeal held that the trial judge erred in classifying the incident as a duel, which implies premeditation and mutual arrangement. The court emphasized that the true legal question was whether the killing occurred in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation, per section 318 of the Criminal Code. Given the immediate nature of the confrontation and absence of cooling time, the court found that the circumstances warranted a verdict of manslaughter rather than murder. Consequently, the conviction was substituted from murder to manslaughter under section 325 of the Criminal Code, and the death sentence was replaced with ten years of hard labor.",
