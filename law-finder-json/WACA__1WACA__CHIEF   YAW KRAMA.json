  "summary": "This 1933 West African Court of Appeal case involved Chief Yaw Krampa (later substituted by Isaac Edward Nkrumah) appealing a Divisional Court judgment that partially favored him and the defendant, G. A. Sac Key. The plaintiff sought cancellation of a 1919 deed of conveyance on two alternative grounds: fraud and the assertion that no land had ever been conveyed. The lower court found the deed void due to fraud but also ruled that the land had been sold under native custom, thus dismissing the alternative claim. On appeal, the court held that in the absence of a cross-action, the plaintiff was entitled to full judgment if either claim succeeded, and the court could not enter judgment for the defendant on the failed alternative. Furthermore, under section 58 of the Native Administration Ordinance, the court lacked jurisdiction to determine whether a conveyance occurred under native custom. The appeal was allowed, the portion of the judgment favoring the defendant was set aside, and costs were awarded.",
