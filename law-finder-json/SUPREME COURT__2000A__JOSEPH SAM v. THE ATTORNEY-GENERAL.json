  "caseTitle": "JOSEPH SAM v. THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL",
  "summary": "In Joseph Sam v. The Attorney-General, the plaintiff, a Ghanaian citizen, invoked the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction under Article 2(1) of the 1992 Constitution to challenge the constitutionality of Section 15 of PNDCL 326, which granted immunity to the state and its officers from legal proceedings arising from divestiture activities. The defendant raised a preliminary objection, arguing that the plaintiff lacked standing due to absence of personal interest or an existing dispute. The Supreme Court rejected this, holding that Article 2(1) allows any citizen to seek constitutional interpretation without needing to demonstrate personal injury or an active controversy, distinguishing it from Article 33(1), which requires personal interest for enforcement of fundamental rights. The court emphasized that the Constitution must be interpreted based on its own text and spirit, not by analogy to foreign jurisdictions, and affirmed that citizens have a public duty to defend the Constitution. The preliminary objection was overruled, establishing that standing under Article 2(1) is broad and accessible to all citizens for upholding constitutional supremacy.",
