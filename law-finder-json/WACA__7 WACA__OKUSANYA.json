  "summary": "This 1941 Privy Council judgment arose from a long-standing land dispute between the Ake and Ijesha peoples in Nigeria, focusing on the scope of 'farming rights' granted to Ijesha over specified farms under the 1924 Tew judgment. The appellants (Ake) sought declarations that Ijesha's farming rights did not include reaping palm or kola nuts from trees planted by Ake, paying no tribute, or felling timber. The lower courts dismissed the claims based on res judicata and the irrelevance of the felling claim due to forestry regulations. The Privy Council held that while some claims were res judicata—such as reaping palm nuts and planting cocoa and kola trees—the issues of tribute payment and reaping produce from trees planted by Ake had not been finally adjudicated and were not barred. The claim regarding felling trees was not res judicata but was considered misconceived due to statutory forestry control, though the Council expressed no view on underlying customary rights.",
