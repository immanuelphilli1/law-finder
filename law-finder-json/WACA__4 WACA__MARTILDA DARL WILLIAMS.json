  "caseTitle": "MARTILDA DARL WILLIAMS",
  "summary": "The appeal concerned garnishee proceedings involving ₤7 7s. 0d. held in court as proceeds of execution from a writ of Pi Pa issued for the respondent, Mumni Ayinde. The appellant, E. J. Alex Taylor, sought to attach the funds through a motion in a suit to which he was not a party. The West Africa Court of Appeal held that money in custodia legis belongs to the defendant and can only be attached by a creditor who has obtained judgment and follows proper execution procedures. The appeal was dismissed because the appellant's motion was incompetent, and the respondent was awarded costs of half a guinea.",
