  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision in Civil Appeal No. J4/25/2006, delivered on 27th July 2009, concerned an estate dispute over ownership of a house and two cocoa farms between family members. The plaintiffs claimed the properties were family assets, while the defendants asserted they were self-acquired by their late father/husband. The High Court and Court of Appeal ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, relying heavily on oral testimony from key witnesses (PW1 and PW5). However, the Supreme Court overturned this, emphasizing that concurrent findings of fact cannot be reversed lightly unless strong legal or factual reasons exist—which were present here. The Court found that documentary evidence (Exhibits 2 and 4), including a 1958 development permit application and payment receipts, strongly contradicted the plaintiff's claim that the house was completed in 1955. Given colonial building regulations requiring permits, construction before 1958 was implausible. The Court also noted inconsistencies in witness testimony, particularly regarding who managed the store and farm, and whether family members contributed to cultivation. It held that documentary evidence should prevail over oral accounts under established precedent, and that the plaintiff’s later connection of utilities to the house did not confer co-ownership but at most a claim for restitution. The cocoa farms were determined to be self-acquired, as cultivation began before the plaintiff left for Britain and was primarily managed by the defendant's late father with minimal family involvement. The Supreme Court thus allowed the appeal, finding the lower courts erred in failing to critically assess these contradictions.",
