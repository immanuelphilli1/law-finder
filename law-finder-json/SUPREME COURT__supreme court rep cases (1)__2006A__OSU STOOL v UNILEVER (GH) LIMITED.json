  "caseTitle": "OSU STOOL v UNILEVER (GH) LIMITED",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed the appeal brought by the Osu Stool, represented by the Mankralo, challenging the Court of Appeal's decision to allow Nii Nortey Owuo III, the Osu Mantse, to be substituted as the proper representative of the Osu Stool in a land-related civil suit against Unilever (Gh) Limited. The core issue was whether the dispute involved a chieftaincy matter outside the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts. The Supreme Court held that no genuine chieftaincy dispute arose, as the Osu Mantse presented prima facie evidence of his status via an extract from the National Register of Chiefs, which is statutorily recognized under Section 50(8) of the Chieftaincy Act, 1970 (Act 370). The appellant's attempt to challenge this using a PNDC-era letter withdrawing government recognition failed, as such withdrawal affects only statutory functions, not customary status. The Court emphasized that the issue was one of statutory and legal interpretation, not indigenous custom, and thus within the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts. It reaffirmed that under customary law, the occupant of the stool (the Osu Mantse) is the proper person to represent the stool in litigation, citing Akwei v. Awuletey (1960). The appeal was dismissed.",
