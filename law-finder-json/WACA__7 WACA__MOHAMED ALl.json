  "caseTitle": "MOHAMED ALl",
  "summary": "This case involved a civil appeal before the West African Court of Appeal concerning a dispute over unpaid salary under a contract of employment. The plaintiff, Mohamed Ali, claimed a difference between the salary he alleged was due and the amount paid by the defendants, L. Ambrosini Limited. The trial judge based his decision on an unsigned, undated, and unstamped copy of an agreement with a third party, Auerbacher, which the appellate court held should not have been admitted and had no evidential value. The appellate court found that the trial judge misdirected himself by failing to recognize that successive salary reductions—from £12 to £10, then £8, and finally £6 per month—were communicated by the employer and accepted by the plaintiff, as evidenced by his conduct and pleadings. The court rejected the notion that these were arbitrary deductions, noting they were tied to performance. The appeal was allowed, judgment was entered for the defendants, and costs were awarded at thirty guineas.",
