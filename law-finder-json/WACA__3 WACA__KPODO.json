  "summary": "This case involved a claim by A. C. Kpodo, the plaintiff-respondent, against Swiss African Trading Co. Ltd., the defendant-appellant, for damages due to wrongful termination of employment, filed in the District Magistrate's Court at Accra. The Magistrate ruled for the defendant but referred a legal question to the Supreme Court (Divisional Court) under Section 47 of the Courts Ordinance, asking whether Section 8 of the Master and Servants' Ordinance applied. The Divisional Court held that it did not apply and directed the case back for assessment of damages. The defendant appealed to the West African Court of Appeal. The Court dismissed the appeal, holding that no appeal lies from an opinion of the Supreme Court on a case stated under Section 47, as the Court was not sitting in original or appellate jurisdiction. The appeal was therefore not within the jurisdiction conferred by Sections 3 or 4 of the West African Court of Appeal Ordinance, 1935.",
