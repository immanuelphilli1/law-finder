  "caseTitle": "CHARITY AGYEIWAH v E.M.S., P&T CORPORATI ON",
  "summary": "In this 2008 Supreme Court of Ghana case, Charity Agyeiwah appealed against E.M.S., P&T Corporation regarding a lost parcel containing £10,000 worth of travellers' cheques sent to the UK. The trial court ruled in her favor, but the Court of Appeal reversed the decision, citing lack of jurisdiction by the trial judge to declare a statutory provision unconstitutional and questioning the evidence. The Supreme Court found that the Court of Appeal erred in dismissing the factual basis of the claim, particularly given corroboration by the defendant's own witness (DW1) who confirmed receipt of the travellers' cheques. However, the Court held that the constitutional issue—whether Section 43(1) of NRCD 311 was inconsistent with Article 18(2) of the 1992 Constitution—was irrelevant because the contract predated the Constitution’s enforcement and thus could not be applied retroactively. The appeal was allowed on factual grounds, emphasizing that the appellate court should have referred the constitutional question to the Supreme Court under Article 130(2) if deemed material.",
