  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case centered on the validity of a property sale conducted under a writ of execution to satisfy a judgment debt. The appellants, Bernard Nimako Akowuah and Samuel Nii Otu Ankrah, challenged the lower courts' rulings that voided the auction sale of property (H/No B182/12, Odorkor, Accra) owned by Adjin Okwabi, the late father of respondent Madam Naadu. The core issue was whether the judgment debt owed by Joshua Kpakpo Allotey (nephew of Adjin Okwabi and cousin of the respondent) had been fully paid before the execution and sale. The trial court and Court of Appeal found that the debt was paid in full by January 31, 1989, rendering the subsequent sale on June 12, 1989, void. The Supreme Court affirmed this, citing Karimu v Ghassoub, holding that once a judgment debt is paid, the legal basis for execution ceases. Additionally, the courts found serious irregularities in the bail bond documentation (Exhibit F2), where Adjin Okwabi’s name was substituted for an original surety without proper execution (lacking his thumbprint as an illiterate), making the suretyship unenforceable. The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts’ findings, dismissing the appeal and affirming that the sale was void and conferred no title to the purchaser.",
