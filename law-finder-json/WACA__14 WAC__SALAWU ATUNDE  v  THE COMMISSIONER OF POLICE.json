  "caseTitle": "SALAWU ATUNDE v THE COMMISSIONER OF POLICE",
  "summary": "The appellant, Salawu Atunde, was convicted alongside a co-accused, Lamidi Alabi, for stealing 70 bundles of fishing twine. The prosecution established that 17 bundles were found in a shop linked to the appellant, who admitted possessing six bundles entrusted to him by the co-accused. The Magistrate did not discharge the co-accused at the close of the prosecution case, nor confirm that the appellant was informed of his rights under section 287(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance. The appellant gave sworn evidence but was not cross-examined, and was immediately convicted with minimal reasoning. On appeal, the West African Court of Appeal found procedural irregularities—including failure to ensure the co-accused was discharged before the defense and lack of confirmation that the appellant was informed of his right to call witnesses. Although the irregularities did not clearly affect the outcome, a bare possibility of prejudice existed. The appeal was allowed, the conviction quashed, and a re-trial ordered.",
