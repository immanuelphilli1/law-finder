  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC v HIGH COURT, FAST TRACK 11 GHANA LOTT",
  "summary": "This 2009 Supreme Court of Ghana ruling addresses the jurisdictional issue arising from the transfer of a case between High Court judges without a formal order from the Chief Justice under Section 104(1)-(3) of the Courts Act, 1993 (Act 459). The Ghana Lotto Operators Association challenged the validity of proceedings before Justice Ofori-Atta, arguing he lacked jurisdiction because no official transfer order existed from Justice Asante. The Supreme Court examined the scope of the Chief Justice's power to transfer cases and whether a judge becomes 'seised' of a case merely upon listing or only after commencing hearing. While referencing prior case law like Osei v. The Republic (1968), the court considered whether listing constitutes being 'seised' and emphasized that Section 104 allows transfer at any stage of proceedings. The court ultimately held that the absence of a formal transfer order, coupled with no exceptional circumstances or evidence of authorization, rendered the proceedings before Ofori-Atta J. jurisdictionally defective, thus granting the application to quash those proceedings.",
