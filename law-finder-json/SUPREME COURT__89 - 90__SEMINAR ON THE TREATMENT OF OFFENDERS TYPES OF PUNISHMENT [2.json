  "caseTitle": "SEMINAR ON THE TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS TYPES OF PUNISHMENT [2",
  "summary": "This academic paper by Senah K.A., a lecturer in Sociology at the University of Ghana, explores the historical evolution of punishment across societies, from early tribal systems to modern penological practices. It distinguishes between public crimes (e.g., incest, witchcraft) and private crimes (e.g., murder, theft), emphasizing the collective and spiritual dimensions of justice in traditional societies. The paper details various punitive methods such as flogging, mutilation, branding, stocks, and capital punishment, noting their persistence into early modern times. It critiques the continued use of corporal and inhumane prison conditions, even in contemporary settings like Ghana, and advocates for a humanistic, rehabilitative approach in line with modern penological principles.",
