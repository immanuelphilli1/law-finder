  "summary": "This appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council concerned a civil dispute over title and possession of a house in Ashanti, Ghana. The respondent obtained a consent judgment in the Divisional Court of the Supreme Court in 1939, which the appellant later challenged on grounds of lack of jurisdiction, arguing that the matter should have been heard by a Native Court under the Native Courts (Ashanti) Ordinance. The Privy Council held that although the Supreme Court's jurisdiction is concurrent with Native Courts in certain matters, it is only ousted under section 35 of the Native Courts Ordinance if the issue is raised and considered before judgment. Since the jurisdictional issue was not submitted or apparent before the 1939 judgment, the Supreme Court's judgment remained valid. Additionally, the Court ruled that a consent judgment cannot be reviewed under Order 42 of the Courts Ordinance merely by judicial discretion, especially where the compromise terms were not fully known to the court. The appeal was dismissed.",
