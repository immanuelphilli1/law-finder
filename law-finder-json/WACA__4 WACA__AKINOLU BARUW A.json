  "caseTitle": "AKINOLU BARUW A",
  "summary": "In this civil land dispute heard by the West African Court of Appeal, the plaintiff-appellant, Akinolu Baruwa, sought a declaration of title to land in Odogun, Isheri District. The claim was dismissed against the first two defendants who contested it, as the plaintiff failed to discharge the onus of clearly identifying the land claimed. No valid plan was presented, and the one referenced (Exhibit A) related to a different case concerning Ito Abo Swamp in Ikorodu, making it irrelevant. The plaintiff's own witness gave inconsistent testimony, further undermining the claim. The court upheld the dismissal against the first two defendants due to failure to establish a prima facie case. However, regarding the third and fourth defendants, who did not dispute the claim, the court ruled that a non-suit should have been entered instead of a dismissal. Thus, the appeal was dismissed against the first two defendants with costs, but allowed in part regarding the last two, with the dismissal set aside and a non-suit ordered.",
