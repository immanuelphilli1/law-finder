  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana, in Stephen Nii Bortey Okane v. Electoral Commission (2011), ruled on the constitutional validity of Local Government (Creation of New District Electoral Areas and Designation of Units) Instrument, L.I. 1983. The plaintiff challenged the instrument on grounds that Parliament, through its Subsidiary Legislation Committee, amended it by increasing electoral areas in the Ledzokuku-Krowor District from 12 to 16 without proper authority. The Court held that under Article 11(7) of the 1992 Constitution, Parliament's role is limited to annulment of such instruments within 21 sitting days, not amendment. The power to amend rests with the original maker of the instrument, not Parliament. Since the amendment by Parliament was ultra vires Article 11(7), the four newly added electoral areas were declared void. The Court granted declarations that L.I. 1983, as amended, was unconstitutional and null to the extent of the unauthorized additions, while affirming the validity of the original 24 electoral areas.",
