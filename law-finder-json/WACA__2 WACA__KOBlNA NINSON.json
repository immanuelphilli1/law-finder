  "caseTitle": "KOBlNA NINSON",
  "summary": "This Privy Council appeal from the Gold Coast Colony (modern-day Ghana) concerned a land dispute between Koibina Ninson (appellant) and Adjuah Aduwah (respondent). The action was initially mischaracterized as trespass, but the Privy Council clarified it was an ejectment action, placing the burden on the plaintiff to prove title. The respondent had not been in possession since 1918, when her son was ejected by the appellant's predecessor, Yaw Kyei, who then cultivated the land. The respondent later offered pacification money and rent, implicitly recognizing the appellant's title. Despite the Full Court's restoration of a Native Tribunal judgment in her favor based on a questionable admission of possession, the Privy Council found that the Provincial Commissioner alone correctly understood the case. The appeal was allowed, the Full Court's judgment set aside, and the Provincial Commissioner's dismissal of the claim restored, as the plaintiff failed to prove her title and had acquiesced in the defendant's possession for over nine years.",
