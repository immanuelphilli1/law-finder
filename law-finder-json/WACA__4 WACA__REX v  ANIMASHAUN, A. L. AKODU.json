  "caseTitle": "REX v ANIMASHAUN, A. L. AKODU",
  "summary": "The appellants were summarily convicted and committed to prison for perjury during a civil proceeding under section 41 of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance. The Crown initially objected that no appeal lay against such a committal for contempt. The West African Court of Appeal held that an appeal was permissible, distinguishing English common law principles by reference to the West African Court of Appeal Ordinance No. 47 of 1933, which granted a broad right of appeal from any conviction by the Supreme Court, High Court, or Native Court, regardless of whether the conviction was on indictment or summary. The court overruled the preliminary objection, affirming appellate jurisdiction over the matter.",
