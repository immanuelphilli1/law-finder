  "caseTitle": "SARKIS MADI",
  "summary": "This case originated from a civil dispute in the Supreme Court of the Gambia, where Michael Abdallah sued Sarkis Madi to declare void an agreement that settled a judgment debt of £7,920 9s. 0d. The agreement, dated 19 June 1925, stipulated that upon Madi paying £3,500 and assigning certain debts and a mortgage to Abdallah, the latter would release the outstanding debt and abandon execution. Although the document was signed, it was retained by Abdallah’s solicitor until performance. Madi fulfilled the conditions within two weeks, including arranging payments via third parties and executing the required assignments. The trial court dismissed the claim, finding valid consideration, but the West African Court of Appeal reversed, citing lack of consideration on the face of the document. On appeal to the Privy Council, the judgment was restored in favor of Madi. The Board held that the agreement constituted a valid contract supported by sufficient consideration, including the payment, assignments, and abandonment of appeal, and that these elements collectively satisfied the requirements for accord and satisfaction, thereby barring enforcement of the original judgment.",
