  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC v THE HIGH COURT, ACCRA(COMMERCIAL DIVISION)",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana considered whether Justice Tanko Amadu of the Commercial Division had jurisdiction to hear a contempt application after the legal vacation period had ended. The contempt arose from enforcement of a writ of possession related to an estate dispute. Although the judge had been authorized to sit during the 2008 legal vacation (August–September), he ruled on the contempt matter on 20 October 2008—after his vacation mandate lapsed and without formal transfer of the case to his division. The Court held that he was not properly seized of the matter at that time, as the case was originally filed in a different division. While certiorari is discretionary, the Court emphasized that parties must object promptly to jurisdictional defects. The ruling reaffirmed the importance of statutory compliance, judicial discipline, and the Chief Justice’s role in case transfers to prevent forum shopping and maintain judicial order.",
