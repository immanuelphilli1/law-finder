  "summary": "In Danielli Construction Ltd v Mabey & Johnson Ltd, the Supreme Court of Ghana reversed the Court of Appeal's judgment that had awarded damages to the plaintiff for breach of a swap agreement. The plaintiff had claimed the defendant failed to deliver a crushing plant in exchange for a piling hammer and car. The trial court initially found a hiring contract, but the Court of Appeal recharacterized it as a swap agreement and awarded cedi equivalent of $890,411 in damages. The Supreme Court held that the defendant had constructively delivered the crushing plant by making it available for collection at its site, in line with the parties' established practice. The plaintiff’s failure to collect the equipment, without offering rebuttal evidence, amounted to an admission of the defendant’s position. The Court found no breach by the defendant, overturned the damages award, and allowed the appeal in full, emphasizing that the plaintiff was responsible for its own loss.",
