  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana chieftaincy appeal concerned ownership of the Suhyen Stool, originally created in 1915 by the Asona clan under the authority of the New Juaben Omanhene. The dispute arose after the stool was elevated to a Divisional (Mponua) status in 1954 during the reign of Nana Frimpong Manso I of the Ekuona clan. The Appellants (Ekuona clan) argued that the elevation constituted a new creation gifted to them, and that over 50 years of occupancy established their ownership through acquiescence and estoppel. The Respondents (Asona clan) maintained they remained the rightful owners, as the black stool symbolizing ownership was created by their ancestors and never transferred. The Supreme Court upheld the National House of Chiefs’ decision, ruling that elevation did not create a new stool, no legal gift was proven, and the Asona clan’s conditional consent to Ekuona occupants negated estoppel or conclusive presumption under the Evidence Decree (NRCD 323). The Court emphasized that mere occupancy does not equate to ownership in customary law.",
