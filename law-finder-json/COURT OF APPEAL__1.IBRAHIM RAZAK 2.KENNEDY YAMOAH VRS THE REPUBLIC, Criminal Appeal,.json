  "summary": "The Court of Appeal of Ghana dismissed the appeal against conviction but allowed the appeal against sentence in this armed robbery case. The appellants, Ibrahim Razak and Kennedy Yamoah, were convicted by the High Court for participating in a robbery at West Anaji, Takoradi, on 27 July 2005, where five armed men stole over Gh\u000210 million, cloth, watches, and phones. They were each sentenced to life imprisonment. On appeal, the Court found no bias in the trial judge's reference to their Nigerian nationality, which was confirmed by their own testimony. The alibi defense by the second appellant was thoroughly considered and rejected due to significant inconsistencies in his and his witnesses' statements. Both appellants were properly identified, with the second appellant's identification supported by evidence and his own admission. While the conviction was upheld, the life sentences were deemed unduly harsh and were reduced to 30 years imprisonment on each count, to run concurrently. The Court also upheld the order for deportation to Nigeria upon completion of sentence.",
