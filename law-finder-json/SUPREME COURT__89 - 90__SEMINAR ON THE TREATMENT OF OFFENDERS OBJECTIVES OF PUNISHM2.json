  "caseTitle": "SEMINAR ON THE TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS OBJECTIVES OF PUNISHM2",
  "summary": "This legal commentary by A.N. Dokurugu, presented at a seminar on the treatment of offenders, examines the various objectives and justifications of punishment within the Ghanaian legal and social context. The paper analyzes punishment not as an end in itself but as a means to achieve societal goals such as deterrence, prevention, retribution, expiation, restitution, and reformation. It emphasizes that in an imperfect society, punishment is necessary for the enforcement of laws and the self-defense of the community. The author discusses how deterrence must involve penalties that clearly outweigh the benefits of crime to influence potential offenders. Retribution is framed as society's moral response to crime, maintaining ethical balance. The paper also highlights the importance of rehabilitation, particularly through social work in correctional settings, where professionals assist in behavioral change, family support, and reintegration. Social workers are seen as vital in coordinating services, providing therapy, and linking inmates with community resources. The piece concludes that while an ideal society might not require punishment, current realities necessitate a balanced system that incorporates both punitive and reformative approaches.",
