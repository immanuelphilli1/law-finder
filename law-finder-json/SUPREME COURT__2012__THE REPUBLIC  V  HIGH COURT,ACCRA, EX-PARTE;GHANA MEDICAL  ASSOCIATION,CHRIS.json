  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC V HIGH COURT,ACCRA, EX-PARTE;GHANA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION,CHRIS",
  "summary": "The Ghana Medical Association (GMA) applied to the Supreme Court for judicial review of a High Court judge's decision to proceed with hearing an interlocutory injunction and substantive matter in a case involving a labor dispute and alleged human rights violations. The GMA argued that the High Court lacked jurisdiction because the plaintiff, Chris Archmann-Akumey, improperly invoked the court's authority via a writ of summons instead of a motion supported by affidavit as required under constitutional human rights procedures. Additionally, the GMA contended that only the National Labour Commission (NLC) could initiate proceedings on labor disputes in essential services, and that the judge exhibited bias by indicating he would rule on the injunction if the plaintiff had capacity. The Supreme Court dismissed the application, holding that the supervisory jurisdiction under Article 132 of the 1992 Constitution applies only to manifest errors going to jurisdiction or fundamental flaws, and found no such error here. It ruled that civil proceedings may validly commence by writ under CI 47, Order 2, and that the judge’s statements did not demonstrate bias but reflected a logical sequence of rulings. The Court emphasized that mere anticipation of a ruling order does not equate to predetermination.",
