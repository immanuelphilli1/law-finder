  "caseTitle": "AND ANOTHER VERSUS GADRI AND ANOTHER",
  "summary": "In Azametsi and Another v. Gadri and Another, the Court of Appeal of Ghana held that an arbitration award concerning ownership of the Ziwe creek could not bind the plaintiffs' family (Aweku family) because the individuals who participated in the arbitration—Egui Tsidi and Dakohu Damawu—lacked authority to represent the family. The plaintiffs had appointed these men as caretakers during their absence, but they were not shown to be family members or authorized agents for litigation or arbitration over family property. The court reaffirmed that only the head of a family or a properly accredited representative can bind the family in matters concerning family property, including arbitration. Since the plaintiffs' family was neither a party nor privy to the arbitration before the Paramount Chief, the award did not estop them from asserting exclusive title. The appeal was dismissed, restoring the trial Native Court's decision recognizing the Aweku family's absolute ownership.",
