  "summary": "In Sebastian Dzaisu & 92 Ors v Ghana Breweries Ltd (Supreme Court, 28th May 2008, Civil Appeal No. J4/29/2007), 93 casual workers appealed their dismissal and sought equal benefits with permanent staff under a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). They argued that performing the same work entitled them to equal treatment under the 1992 Constitution (Articles 16(1), 21(1)(e), 24) and the Labour Decree 1967 (NLCD 157). The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision dismissing the claim, ruling that the appellants failed to provide sufficient evidence that they performed substantially the same work as permanent employees. The Court emphasized that a bare repetition of pleadings in testimony without elaboration or corroborative evidence does not meet the burden of proof. Evidence from the respondent showed that permanent workers operated sophisticated machinery and were skilled, while casual workers performed manual tasks like packing and cleaning. The Court affirmed that appellate courts may set aside factual findings unsupported by evidence, citing Adokor v. Gatsi and Domfe v. Adu. The appeal was dismissed as being against the weight of evidence.",
