  "caseTitle": "REX v DAVID EDGAL,",
  "summary": "In this 1938 West Africa Court of Appeal case, Rex v. David Edgal and others, the appellants were convicted under section 230 of the Criminal Code for supplying substances to procure abortion unlawfully. The prosecution did not allege the substances were noxious, relying instead on the broad wording of the statute. The appellants argued that only noxious substances could form the basis of a conviction, citing Rex v. Isaacs. The Court distinguished that case, holding that under the Nigerian Criminal Code, the nature of the substance was irrelevant. The central issue became the meaning of 'unlawfully.' Relying on Rex v. Bourne, the Court held that abortion is unlawful unless performed in good faith to preserve the mother's life, reflecting the common law of England as applicable in Nigeria under the Protectorate Courts Ordinance. The appeals were dismissed, affirming that the absence of a specific exception in the Code did not render all abortions lawful. The judgment affirmed that the protection of unborn life is a principle of the common law, and only life-saving interventions are lawful.",
