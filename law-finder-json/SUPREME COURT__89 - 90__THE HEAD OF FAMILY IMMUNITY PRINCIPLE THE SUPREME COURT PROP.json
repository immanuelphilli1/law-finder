  "caseTitle": "THE HEAD OF FAMILY IMMUNITY PRINCIPLE THE SUPREME COURT PROP",
  "summary": "In Hansen v Ankrah, the Ghanaian Supreme Court, by a 3-2 majority, upheld the 'head of family immunity principle,' ruling that a family head cannot be sued in court for an account of family property while still in office, despite a duty to account at family meetings. The plaintiffs, heads of two family sections, sought orders compelling the family head to account for mismanaged funds and to preserve assets. The High Court granted interim relief, but the Court of Appeal and then the Supreme Court dismissed the action, citing immunity. The dissent argued for accountability, uniformity in customary law, and the principle that no breach of trust should lack a remedy. The decision highlighted a tension between judicial recognition of social authority and the need for legal accountability. Later in 1985, the PNDC abolished the immunity principle legislatively, ending judicial debate.",
