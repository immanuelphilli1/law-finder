  "caseTitle": "AKPAN UNWA UDO EKPO",
  "summary": "The appellant, Akpan Unwa Udo Ekpo, was initially convicted of murder for killing Sambo during a clan affray between the Ediene and Minya clans in Ikot Ekpene. The deceased was a member of the Ediene clan, which initiated the fight and wounded the appellant with an arrow. After the deceased was injured and fell, the appellant inflicted a fatal machete wound. The trial judge ruled it murder, asserting no personal provocation by the deceased. The West Africa Court of Appeal disagreed, holding that the collective clan attack constituted sufficient provocation under section 318 of the Criminal Code. The court found the killing occurred in the heat of passion due to this provocation, warranting reduction of the conviction from murder to manslaughter. The death sentence was set aside and replaced with two years' imprisonment with hard labour.",
