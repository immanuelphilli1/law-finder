  "caseTitle": "OCCUPANTS OF GA, GBESE AND KORLE STOOLS, ACCRA v. PAUL",
  "summary": "This Court of Appeal decision from Ghana addresses a procedural error in the substitution of a party in a civil case. The original defendant, Paul Ayitey Tetteh, appealed against a High Court order that substituted him with B.A. Quarcoo as the head of the Onamroko-Adain family. The Court of Appeal held that the substitution was improperly granted ex parte without notice to the original defendant, violating Order 52 Rules 3 and 6 of the High Court Civil Procedure Rules (L.N. 140A, 1954). The trial judge failed to ensure proper service and inquiry into the defendant's absence, rendering the substitution order void. The appeal succeeded, the substitution was set aside, and costs were awarded to the appellant.",
