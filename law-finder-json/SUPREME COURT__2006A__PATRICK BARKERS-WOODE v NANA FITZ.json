  "caseTitle": "PATRICK BARKERS-WOODE v NANA FITZ",
  "summary": "In this 2006 Supreme Court of Ghana decision, the court reviewed a dispute over the construction and ownership of a building near Achimota, Accra. The plaintiff, Patrick Barkers-Woode, claimed he paid 14 million cedis for a contractor, Nana Fitz, to build a house on his land, with the final 3 million cedis due upon completion. When the defendant demanded the balance after roofing was done, the plaintiff refused, asserting the work was incomplete. The defendant claimed the building was complete, the contract was rescinded, and partial refund offered. The trial judge found for the plaintiff, determining the building was not completed. The Court of Appeal reversed this, but the Supreme Court restored the trial judge’s decision, holding that appellate courts cannot overturn supported findings of fact, particularly those involving witness credibility and demeanor. The Supreme Court emphasized the principle that where a trial judge’s factual conclusions are backed by evidence, an appellate court must not interfere, even if it might have interpreted the evidence differently.",
