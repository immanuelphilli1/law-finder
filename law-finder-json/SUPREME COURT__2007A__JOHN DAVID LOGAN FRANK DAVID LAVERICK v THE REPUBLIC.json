  "caseTitle": "JOHN DAVID LOGAN FRANK DAVID LAVERICK v THE REPUBLIC",
  "summary": "In this 2007 Supreme Court of Ghana decision, appellants John David Logan and Frank David Laverick, both British nationals, appealed their convictions for criminal conspiracy and unlawful possession of 588.33 kilograms of cocaine. The prosecution alleged a transnational drug operation involving multiple accused persons, but failed to present direct or circumstantial evidence linking the appellants to the conspiracy or possession. The Supreme Court found the verdicts unreasonable and unsupported by evidence, particularly noting that mere presence at the scene of the crime was insufficient for conviction. The appellants' appeal was allowed, their convictions quashed, and sentences set aside due to lack of evidentiary basis, especially in the absence of any witness implicating them in the criminal acts.",
