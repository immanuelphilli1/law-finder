  "caseTitle": "ERNEST ADOFO AND ANOTHER v THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL AND ANOTHE",
  "summary": "The case involved former employees of the Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod) who were retrenched in 1994 and denied terminal benefits under PNDC Law 125, which indemnified the Board from liability. The plaintiffs sought declarations that PNDC Law 125 was unconstitutional, particularly Sections 5 and 6, which barred legal actions related to retrenchment and abated pending suits. Initially filed on behalf of 70 workers, the suit was later amended to represent only the three named plaintiffs. The Supreme Court narrowed the issue to the constitutionality of PNDC Law 125’s restrictions on access to courts. All parties agreed that the core issue was whether these provisions violated the 1992 Constitution. The Court affirmed its exclusive jurisdiction under Article 130(1) and the supremacy of the Constitution under Article 1(2), holding that any law inconsistent with the Constitution is void. It found that Sections 5 and 6 of PNDC Law 125 unjustifiably limited access to justice and were therefore unconstitutional.",
