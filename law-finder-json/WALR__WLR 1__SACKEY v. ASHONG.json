  "caseTitle": "SACKEY VERSUS ASHONG",
  "summary": "In Sackey v. Ashong, the plaintiff sought recovery of possession of a property in Accra, alleging fraudulent misrepresentation and breach of lease terms. The trial court ruled in her favor, citing equitable fraud, failure to agree on initial repair costs as a condition precedent, and breach of an implied repair covenant. On appeal, the West African Court of Appeal reversed, holding that there was no evidence of equitable fraud and that the plaintiff was estopped by her conduct from denying consent to the defendant's occupation. The court found that the defendant's substantial repairs and continued possession constituted part performance, rendering the agreement enforceable under the principles in Richardson v. Gifford and Walsh v. Lonsdale. It further ruled that the absence of a proviso for re-entry in the proposed lease terms meant that breach of the repair covenant did not entitle the landlord to possession. The appeal was allowed, and the order for possession set aside.",
