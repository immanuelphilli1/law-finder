  "caseTitle": "YAW OPPONG VRS CHARLES ANARFI",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case arose from a dispute over whether a transaction involving GH¢40,000 and a property at Plot 35, Block AB, Patase, West Kumasi, was a sale or a loan secured by the property. The plaintiff (Yaw Oppong) claimed he purchased the house, relying on Exhibit A, labeled a sale agreement. The defendant (Charles Anarfi) argued it was a loan and he used the house as security, signing the document under false assurances. The High Court found it was a loan and ordered repayment with interest. The Court of Appeal reversed, finding a valid sale. The Supreme Court restored the High Court’s decision, holding that Exhibit A was effectively a receipt, not a registrable instrument affecting land. It emphasized that the appellant failed to timely challenge the admissibility of Exhibit A and that the principles of contract law, including the inadmissibility of extrinsic evidence to vary written terms (Wilson v. Brobbey), bound the defendant to the document he signed. The Court also found no substantial miscarriage of justice from the admission of Exhibit A and concluded the transaction was a loan, not a sale.",
