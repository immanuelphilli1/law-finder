  "summary": "This is a civil appeal before the Supreme Court of Ghana concerning the refusal by the Court of Appeal to relist an appeal that had been struck out for non-compliance with procedural conditions. The appellant, Doku Agbeyevu, was a co-defendant in a High Court case decided on 11/10/2001. He filed a notice of appeal on 2/11/2001 but failed to fully comply with the High Court registrar's conditions for preparing the record, particularly regarding payment for binding and photocopying. Although he paid a deposit of ₵500,000, he withdrew part of another payment and did not fulfill all requirements. A Certificate of Non-Compliance was issued on 8/11/2005, and the Court of Appeal struck out the appeal on 4/4/2006. The appellant sought relistment on 3/7/2007, over a year later, but the application was dismissed. The Supreme Court upheld this decision, emphasizing that procedural rules governing appeals must be followed, and that the Court of Appeal had fairly exercised its discretion under Rule 18(3) of CI 19. The appeal was dismissed.",
