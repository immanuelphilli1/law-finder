  "caseTitle": "Ex PARTE MICHAEL ADBALLAH",
  "summary": "This appeal arose from an order by the Supreme Court of the Gambia requiring solicitor Ladepon Thomas to pay the respondent, Michael Adballah, the sum of £221 allegedly retained from funds recovered under a judgment. The West African Court of Appeal held that the order was improperly made under the court's summary jurisdiction because no solicitor-client relationship existed between Adballah and Thomas; Thomas had been engaged solely by Mr. Barlatt, Adballah's solicitor. The court reaffirmed that summary orders compelling payment of funds by a solicitor to a client require a direct solicitor-client relationship at the time of receipt of funds. It further recognized Thomas's right to assert a lien for unpaid services and Barlatt's independent lien over the recovered amount. The appeal was allowed, the order set aside, and parties directed to bear their own costs in the lower court, though Thomas was awarded costs of appeal due to procedural impropriety in the original application.",
