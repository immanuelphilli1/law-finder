  "caseTitle": "DUFFIELD VERSUS WEBSTER.",
  "summary": "In Duffield v. Webster, the Supreme Court of the Colony of the Gambia struck out a writ of defamation for insufficient particulars. The plaintiff alleged libel in an unspecified letter from February 1956 and slander involving imputations about professional irresponsibility, but failed to provide details such as dates, specific words, or recipients. The court held that a defamation writ must contain sufficient particulars to inform the defendant of the case they must meet, especially under Gambian rules which emphasize early specificity due to the general absence of mandatory pleadings. Citing Collins v. Jones, the court emphasized that a plaintiff cannot maintain a defamation claim based on mere suspicion or without knowledge of the actual defamatory words. The writ was dismissed with costs, reflecting the necessity of concrete allegations in defamation actions.",
