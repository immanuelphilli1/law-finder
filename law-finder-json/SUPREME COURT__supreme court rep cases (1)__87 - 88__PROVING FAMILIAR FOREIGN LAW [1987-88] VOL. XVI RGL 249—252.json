  "caseTitle": "PROVING FAMILIAR FOREIGN LAW [1987-88] VOL. XVI RGL 249—252",
  "summary": "This legal commentary examines the challenges of proving foreign law in Ghanaian courts, particularly when the foreign law is from common law or African customary law jurisdictions familiar to Ghana. It critiques the traditional English rule that foreign law must be pleaded and proven as a fact through expert testimony, arguing that this approach is inefficient and impractical when dealing with legal systems closely related to Ghana's. The author proposes that Ghanaian courts should apply the doctrine of judicial notice to recognize foreign rules from common law and neighboring African customary law systems, provided they are well-known or easily verifiable. The Commentary on the Evidence Decree, 1975 is cited in support, noting that foreign law may be judicially noticed if it can be accurately determined from reliable sources. The article also suggests procedural safeguards, such as requiring parties to provide notice of foreign law they intend to rely on, to ensure fairness. The case of Jadbranska Slobodna Plovidba, Split v Oysa Ltd is referenced, where the High Court applied English law without expert testimony, illustrating a practical departure from strict proof requirements.",
