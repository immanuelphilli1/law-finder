  "caseTitle": "COMMISSIONER OF POLICE VERSUS WEMAH.",
  "summary": "In Commissioner of Police v. Wehah, the Court of Appeal of Ghana upheld the conviction of a municipal councillor for extortion under the Criminal Code, s. 413. The appellant, as a public officer, obtained money from individuals by falsely representing that he could authorize building projects, a power not vested in individual councillors. The court distinguished extortion from corruption, emphasizing that extortion involves obtaining money 'under colour of office' through misrepresentation of authority, without requiring proof of a specific duty. The judgment clarified that under s. 437 of the Criminal Code, the essence of extortion is the abuse of office for personal gain, regardless of whether the accused was discharging an official duty.",
