  "caseTitle": "NICHOLAS BERNARD ASARE v DUPAUL WOOD TREATMENT (GHANA) CO LT",
  "summary": "In Nicholas Bernard Asare v Dupaul Wood Treatment (Ghana) Co Ltd, the Supreme Court of Ghana resolved a dispute between two founding shareholders over shareholding dilution and corporate control. The plaintiff, Asare, claimed he was wrongfully reduced from a 50% to a 10% shareholder and unlawfully removed as a director. The trial court held he had acquiesced to the 10% shareholding, but the Court of Appeal reversed, affirming his status as a 50% shareholder and victim of oppression under Section 218 of the Companies Code 1963. The Supreme Court upheld this, ruling that the new company regulations, which purported to alter shareholding and director appointments, were invalid due to lack of registration and internal inconsistencies (e.g., missing Regulation 56). It confirmed that non-payment for shares does not affect membership and that the unilateral dilution of shares and exclusion from management constituted oppressive conduct. The court emphasized strict compliance with statutory procedures for altering company regulations.",
