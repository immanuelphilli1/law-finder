  "caseTitle": "REX v OKERUGWU OGBONNA",
  "summary": "The appellant, Okerugwu Ogbonna, was charged with cheating under section 421 of the Criminal Code for fraudulently obtaining £3 from Victoria Peter by misrepresenting brass trinkets as gold. The prosecution proved that the appellant used false pretences—claiming the trinkets were valuable gold—to secure the loan. While the facts supported a conviction under section 419 (false pretences), the court held that the conviction under section 421 (cheating) could not stand due to lack of evidence that the appellant had gilded the trinkets or used any trick as required under section 421. The appeal was allowed, the conviction and sentence were set aside, and an acquittal was entered.",
