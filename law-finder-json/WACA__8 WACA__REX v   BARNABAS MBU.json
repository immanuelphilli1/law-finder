  "caseTitle": "REX v BARNABAS MBU",
  "summary": "The West Africa Court of Appeal allowed the appeal of Barnabas Mbu, a veterinary assistant with the Bamenda Native Administration, who had been convicted on multiple counts of official corruption and extortion under sections 98 and 99 of the Criminal Code. The court held that the charges were fundamentally flawed because Mbu did not qualify as a 'person employed in the public service' as defined in section 1 of the Criminal Code, since the Bamenda Native Administration had not been formally appointed as a Native Authority under the Native Authority Ordinance No. 43 of 1933. Furthermore, no evidence was presented to prove Mbu's employment status or that he performed duties as a public officer. The court also identified procedural irregularities, including the improper joinder of multiple counts in single charges, absence of dates in the particulars, and insufficient evidence to support one of the convictions. Consequently, all convictions and sentences were quashed, and judgments of acquittal were entered.",
