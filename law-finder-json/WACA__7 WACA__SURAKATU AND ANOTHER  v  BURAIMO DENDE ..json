  "summary": "This 1941 West Africa Court of Appeal decision interprets Section 49(1)(a) of the Protectorate Courts Ordinance, 1933, concerning the employment of legal practitioners in appeals from Native Court decisions in land cases. The court held that although the statute requires the value of property to be both 'stated in the writ of summons' and appear to exceed £200 to a judge, the omission of valuation in Native Court writs—consistent with customary practice—should not bar legal representation. Invoking Maxwell's rule of statutory interpretation, the court disregarded the phrase 'as stated in the writ of summons' where no value was stated, allowing legal practitioners when the judge independently determines the property value exceeds £200.",
