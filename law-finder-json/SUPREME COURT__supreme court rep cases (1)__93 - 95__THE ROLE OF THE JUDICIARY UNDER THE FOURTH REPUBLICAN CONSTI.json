  "caseTitle": "THE ROLE OF THE JUDICIARY UNDER THE FOURTH REPUBLICAN CONSTI",
  "summary": "This document is a lecture delivered by Mr. Enoch D. Kom, analyzing the role and independence of the judiciary under Ghana's Fourth Republican Constitution (1992). It emphasizes the constitutional entrenchment of judicial power, citing Article 125(3), which vests final judicial authority solely in the judiciary, free from executive or legislative interference. The lecture highlights key safeguards including judicial independence (Article 127), security of tenure, legal immunity, and the prohibition on Parliament altering court judgments (Article 107). It references landmark cases such as Mekkaoui v Minister of Internal Affairs and State v Otchere to illustrate past challenges to judicial independence. The Supreme Court is granted exclusive original jurisdiction over constitutional interpretation and enforcement under Article 130(1), and citizens are constitutionally empowered to defend the Constitution under Article 3. The lecture concludes that while the doctrine of separation of powers is not strictly applied due to executive-legislative overlap, the judiciary remains fully separated and empowered as a check on arbitrary power.",
