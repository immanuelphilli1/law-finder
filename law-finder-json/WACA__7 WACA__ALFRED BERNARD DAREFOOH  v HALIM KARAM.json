  "summary": "In Alfred Bernard Darefooh v Halim Karam, the West Africa Court of Appeal reviewed a judgment awarding £350 (including £300 for the value of a lorry and trailer and £50 for loss of earnings) after the defendant wrongfully seized the plaintiff's vehicle. The appellant argued the claim was in detinue and that the court should have ordered return of the lorry or its value, not additional damages for lost earnings. The appellate court held that while the writ was poorly drafted, the rules for assessing damages in detinue and trover are identical, and special damages for loss of earnings are not recoverable because the earning capacity is inherent in the chattel's value. The court affirmed the £300 valuation based on uncontradicted evidence but set aside the £50 for lost earnings. It also ruled that the discretionary power to order return of the chattel should not be exercised where damages provide full compensation and the item is an ordinary article of commerce. The appeal was allowed in part, with costs awarded to the appellant.",
