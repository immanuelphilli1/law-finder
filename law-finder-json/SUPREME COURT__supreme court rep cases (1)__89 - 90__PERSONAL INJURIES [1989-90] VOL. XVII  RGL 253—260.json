  "caseTitle": "APPIAH v BAFFOUR (Aryee Ag J,",
  "summary": "This compilation from the 1989–1990 Review of Ghana Law presents several personal injury cases involving fatal road accidents heard in various High Court divisions across Ghana. The judgments focus on quantifying compensation for loss of dependency, loss of expectation of life, funeral expenses, pain and suffering, and special damages. Awards vary significantly based on the deceased's age, occupation, income, number of dependants, and duration of survival post-accident. Notably, even minors with income-generating activities were awarded for loss of expectation of life. The courts applied multipliers (e.g., years' purchase) to calculate dependency losses, and recognized claims by widows, children, and elderly parents. All cases were civil claims for damages arising from negligence, primarily in road traffic contexts.",
