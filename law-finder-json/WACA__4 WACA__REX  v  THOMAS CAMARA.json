  "caseTitle": "REX v THOMAS CAMARA",
  "summary": "The appellant, Thomas Camara, a public officer, was convicted in the Provincial Court of South Bank Province on three counts of extortion under section 87 of the Criminal Code. He was initially sentenced to six months' imprisonment with hard labor and a fine, with an additional six months in default, to run consecutively. The Supreme Court upheld the convictions but reduced the sentences to four months each, to run concurrently. On appeal to the West Africa Court of Appeal, the appellant challenged the convictions on grounds of trial irregularities and inadmissible evidence. The Court dismissed the appeal, holding that the trial procedure complied with section 113 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the single sentence did not vitiate the trial as it was corrected on appeal, and the evidence—including that of Dr. Bright-Richards and general complaints about staff conduct—was properly admitted. The Court found no prejudice to the appellant and affirmed the convictions.",
