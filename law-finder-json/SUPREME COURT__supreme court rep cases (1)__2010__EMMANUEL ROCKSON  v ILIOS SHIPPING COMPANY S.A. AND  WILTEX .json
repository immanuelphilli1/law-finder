  "caseTitle": "EMMANUEL ROCKSON v ILIOS SHIPPING COMPANY S.A. AND WILTEX",
  "summary": "In Emmanuel Rockson v Ilios Shipping Company S.A. and Wiltex Ltd., the plaintiff, a Ghanaian mariner, sustained injuries while working aboard the M/V Dynamic, a vessel owned by the first defendant and sailing under a Cyprus flag. He filed a writ at the High Court, Sekondi, seeking compensation under a collective insurance policy and 35% interest on the sum due. However, the writ did not disclose a cause of action, containing only a claim for relief without stating the legal basis. The defendants challenged the action on multiple grounds, including lack of jurisdiction and res judicata, but the Supreme Court focused on the fatal defect in the writ. Relying on Republic v High Court, Tema; Ex parte Owners of MV Esco Spirit [2003-2004] SCGLR 689, the Court held that a writ not endorsed with a cause of action is a nullity under Order 2 Rule 1 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules 1954. Despite the plaintiff's supplementary submissions asserting a workmen's compensation claim, he failed to address the jurisdictional defect. The appeal was dismissed solely on this ground, without reaching the merits of the case.",
