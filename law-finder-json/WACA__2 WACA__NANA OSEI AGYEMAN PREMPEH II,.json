  "caseTitle": "IN THE MATTER OF THE BEPOSO CONCESSION-CONCESSION ENQUIRY No",
  "summary": "This 1934 West Africa Court of Appeal decision concerns a concession dispute over the Beposo Lands in Ashanti, Ghana. Herbert Flintoft obtained a 99-year mineral concession from local chiefs in 1931, which was filed and registered in 1932. An initial inquiry on February 27, 1933, resulted in a conditional order for a certificate of validity, but no final order was issued. Nana Kwabena Wusu, Omanhene of Ejisu, first attempted to oppose the concession in August 1933 in his personal capacity, but withdrew the motion. On December 16, 1933, he re-applied to oppose as representative of the Ejisu stool. That motion was adjourned sine die on January 19, 1934, pending resolution of a related land ownership suit. Despite this, a certificate of validity was issued on May 28, 1934, by an acting judge who disregarded the adjournment order. The Court of Appeal held that the final order was invalid because the opposition motion had not been heard, and that the court was bound by the earlier adjournment. The appeal was allowed, the certificate order was set aside, and the matter was remitted for proper adjudication of the opposition motion in accordance with due process and Section 12(2) of the Concessions Ordinance, which requires the court to determine the proper parties.",
