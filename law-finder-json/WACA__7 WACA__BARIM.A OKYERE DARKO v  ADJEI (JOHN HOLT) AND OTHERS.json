  "summary": "This 1941 West African Court of Appeal decision in Accra addressed an appeal brought under section 3(2) of the West African Court of Appeal Ordinance. The court held that section 3(2) applies exclusively to matrimonial matters, and since the case before it did not concern matrimonial issues, the appeal was not maintainable. The appeal was consequently struck out with costs assessed at £18 0s 6d. The case arose from a dispute involving the Native Tribunal of Adontenhene of Akwaphi, Aburi, under the Native Administration Ordinance.",
