  "caseTitle": "REX v AUGUSTINE EGWUATU",
  "summary": "The appellant, Augustine Egwuatu, a public servant and interpreter in the Enugu Local Authority, was convicted of official corruption under section 98(1) of the Criminal Code for accepting a bottle of gin from Belo Amadi as a reward for taking him before the Local Authority. The prosecution's case relied on Exhibit C, a 'chit' presented to Belo, which the trial judge deemed evidence that the appellant was acting in discharge of his official duties. However, Exhibit C was marked for identification but not formally tendered or admitted into evidence until after the defense had closed its case, when the court recalled the third prosecution witness to authenticate it. The West Africa Court of Appeal held that this late admission of a foundational document—after the defense had argued there was no case to answer—constituted a serious procedural irregularity. Since the prosecution had not discharged the burden of proving an essential element of the offense (performance of an official duty) at the close of its case, the subsequent introduction of Exhibit C fundamentally altered the case and caused injustice. The appeal was allowed, the conviction and sentence were quashed, and an acquittal was entered.",
