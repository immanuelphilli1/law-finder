  "summary": "This case involved a landlord's action against a tenant for arrears of rent and recovery of possession of two stores. The Supreme Court of the Gold Coast upheld the finding that the tenant owed arrears of rent amounting to £597 5s., based on the trial judge's acceptance of the landlord's evidence and documentary exhibits (C1–C3), despite conflicting documents (A and B) suggesting a lower rent. However, the appellate court set aside the trial judge's order for recovery of possession, which had been granted on the unproven ground that the tenant had given notice to terminate the tenancy. There was no evidence or cross-examination on this point, and the landlord had not sought to amend pleadings to claim possession for arrears. The appellate court emphasized that possession could not be granted on a ground not properly pleaded or defended, as it would violate principles of procedural fairness and judicial discretion, particularly given the potential for rent to be considered exorbitant under the Rent Control Ordinance, 1952. The appeal was allowed in part, with costs adjusted accordingly.",
