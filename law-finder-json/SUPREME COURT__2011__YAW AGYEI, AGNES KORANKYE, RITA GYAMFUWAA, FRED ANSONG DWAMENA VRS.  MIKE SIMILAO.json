  "summary": "The plaintiffs initiated proceedings at the High Court, Accra, and filed an application for an interlocutory injunction on 12th July 2007, scheduled for hearing on 30th July 2007. The defendant entered a conditional appearance and opposed the application, tendering exhibits. The application was adjourned to 1st November 2007, when it was dismissed by Dzakpasu J. The plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeal, which dismissed their appeal. The case was further appealed to the Supreme Court, where the panel led by Atuguba JSC heard the matter. The judgment was delivered by Ansa JSC, though the full reasoning and final decision are not fully visible due to document truncation.",
