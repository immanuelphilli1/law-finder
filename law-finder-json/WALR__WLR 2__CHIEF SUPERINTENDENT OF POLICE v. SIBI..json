  "caseTitle": "POLICE VERSUS SIBI.",
  "summary": "The appellant, Chief Superintendent of Police, was convicted of parking a vehicle without lights under the Motor Traffic Regulations, 1955, and sentenced to a fine and six-month disqualification from driving. The West African Court of Appeal allowed the appeal against the disqualification. It held that the offence was not 'connected with the driving of a motor vehicle' as required by s.86(1) of the Motor Traffic Ordinance, c.155, and thus disqualification was not a permissible penalty. Additionally, the Trial of Petty Criminal Cases Ordinance, c.25, restricts sentencing options and does not allow for disqualification. Therefore, the disqualification order was ultra vires and quashed, though the fine of \u0005 was upheld as reasonable given the appellant's prior traffic convictions and the danger posed by unlit vehicles.",
