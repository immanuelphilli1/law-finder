  "caseTitle": "KUMAPLE VERSUS AKROBORTU.",
  "summary": "In this land dispute, the plaintiff claimed damages for trespass based on a grant from the male branch of the Titili family. The defendant, from the female branch (Akrobortu family), argued that a prior Native Court judgment established joint ownership of the land between the two branches and that the sale was invalid without their consent. The High Court upheld the Native Appeal Court's decision, ruling that the earlier judgment conferred a legal estate—not merely an equitable interest—on the defendant's family. Under Regulation 40 of the Native Courts (Southern Ghana) Procedure Regulations, 1945, the Native Court had the authority to issue an unrequested order regarding land sharing. The court held that the plaintiff bore the burden of proving that the land sold was within the portion allocated to the male branch following partition, which he failed to do. Consequently, the sale was invalid, and the plaintiff's claim failed.",
