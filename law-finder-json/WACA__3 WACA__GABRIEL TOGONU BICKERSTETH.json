  "summary": "This appeal before the West Africa Court of Appeal concerned the interpretation of a Privy Council costs order following the dismissal of an appeal brought by an executor. The surviving executor, P.H. Williams, had entered into a personal bond for £500 to cover potential costs. After the Privy Council dismissed the appeal and ordered costs, Williams sought a declaration that he was not personally liable and that costs should be paid from the deceased's estate. The lower court agreed, but this decision was reversed on appeal. The WACA held that unless the Privy Council expressly orders costs to be paid from an estate, such liability remains personal, especially where a bond was given. The court emphasized that it could not vary or imply terms into the Privy Council’s order. The appeal succeeded, the lower court’s order was set aside, and Williams remained personally liable for costs, though he retained the right to apply for instalment payments.",
