  "caseTitle": "ANOTHER VERSUS DAKWA.",
  "summary": "This was a civil land dispute between the Asakraka Stool (plaintiffs) and the Bepong Stool (defendant) over ownership of a parcel of land in the Kwahu State. The plaintiffs claimed exclusive title based on an alleged customary arbitration that demarcated a boundary along the Asensefi-Kyekyenamon footpath, placing the disputed land within their stool's territory. A portion of the land had been part of the Worobong Forest Reserve, later released for cultivation. The plaintiffs argued that the defendant was estopped from contesting ownership due to inaction during the Forest Reserve Inquiry, where the land was claimed by a third party, Asafoatse Nimo, without objection from the defendant. The trial Native Court held the land was jointly owned. On appeal, the Land Court, Accra, upheld this decision, finding sufficient evidence supporting joint ownership through customary arbitration. The plea of estoppel by acquiescence failed as the defendant's conduct did not amount to fraud. The court confirmed the appeal was dismissed with costs.",
