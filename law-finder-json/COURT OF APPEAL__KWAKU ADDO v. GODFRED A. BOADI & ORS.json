  "summary": "In Kwaku Addo v. Godfred A. Boadi & Ors. (CA No. 114/2002, 5 March 2004), the Court of Appeal of Ghana set aside the trial High Court's judgment that upheld a redistribution of Opanin Kweku Boadi's estate as a valid negotiated settlement. The appellant had sought to set aside the redistribution, claiming it was an invalid arbitration, and sought injunctions, damages, and refund of payments made to the panel. The trial judge had treated the validity of the arbitration as a preliminary issue and limited evidence accordingly, ultimately ruling it was a negotiated settlement. The Court of Appeal held this was erroneous because the pleaded case centered on arbitration, not negotiated settlement, and the latter was not raised by either party. The court emphasized that arbitration and negotiated settlement are legally distinct under customary law. Additionally, the trial judge's ruling claimed to be based on hearing both counsel, but the record showed no such hearing occurred, raising concerns about extraneous considerations. The court also found procedural irregularity in failing to use Order 36 rule 4 to direct a separate trial of issues, thereby compromising fair trial. Consequently, the appeal succeeded, the lower court's decision was set aside, and a new trial was ordered.",
