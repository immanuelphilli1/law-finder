  "caseTitle": "BLANKSON-MILLS VERSUS BAKO. AND",
  "summary": "In Blankson-Mills v. Bako and Blankson-Mills, an application for final leave to appeal to the Privy Council was dismissed due to inordinate delay. The applicant had obtained conditional leave on September 13, 1950, but only applied for final leave in July 1956, after more than six years. The West African Court of Appeal held that section 20 of the West African (Appeal to Privy Council) Order in Council, 1949, implicitly requires applicants to act with due diligence. The applicant failed to provide cogent reasons for the delay, such as circumstances beyond their control or absence of negligence. Despite the respondents not seeking to rescind the conditional leave, the court ruled this did not excuse the applicant's inaction. The application was dismissed with costs.",
