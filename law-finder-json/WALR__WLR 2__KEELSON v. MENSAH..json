  "caseTitle": "KEELSON VERSUS MENSAH.",
  "summary": "In Keelson v. Mensah, the plaintiff, as head of the Twidan Stool family, sued the defendant, as head of the Adwinadze family, to reclaim ancestral land (Adasemadze) granted historically through a usufructuary gift based on familial brotherhood. The Native Court initially ruled for the plaintiff, citing the defendant's failure to prove title and acknowledging the land was originally gifted. However, on appeal, the Supreme Court of Ghana held that the plaintiff failed to prove the defendant was the head of his family, a necessary condition for suit over family property. Additionally, the court found insufficient evidence that the familial ties had been broken to constitute waste or forfeiture. The appellate court thus set aside the lower court's judgment and dismissed the plaintiff's claim, awarding costs to the defendant.",
