  "caseTitle": "17881 SISMEN NIXON TETTEH v. THE REPUBLIC. A.",
  "summary": "The appellant, Corporal Sismen Nixon Tetteh, was convicted by a Disciplinary Court-Martial for striking and using violence against a superior officer (Provost Marshall) and for conduct prejudicial to good order and discipline. The incident occurred on 19th November 1996 at Burma Camp, Accra, after the Provost Marshall stopped the appellant for running a red light and attempted to seize his identity card, leading to a physical altercation. The appellant denied the charges, claiming self-defence and asserting he did not recognize the complainant. The trial court delivered a one-sentence verdict without providing reasons, which the Supreme Court found problematic. Although the Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, the Supreme Court emphasized that court-martials must provide reasoned judgments under Section 177(1) of Act 30, likening them to panels of judges rather than juries. The Supreme Court ultimately dismissed the appeal, finding sufficient evidence to support the conviction despite procedural shortcomings.",
