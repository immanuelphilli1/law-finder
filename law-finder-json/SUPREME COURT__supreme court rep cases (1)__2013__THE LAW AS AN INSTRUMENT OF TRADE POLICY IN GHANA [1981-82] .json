  "caseTitle": "THE LAW AS AN INSTRUMENT OF TRADE POLICY IN GHANA [1981-82]",
  "summary": "This legal commentary examines the effectiveness of trade regulations in Ghana, particularly the Imports and Exports Act, 1980 (Act 418) and the Imports and Exports (Special Licence) Regulations, 1980 (L.I. 1248). The author argues that despite the existence of these laws, many traders—especially illiterate ones—lack knowledge of them, rendering enforcement through confiscation unjust and high-handed. The piece critiques the legal fiction that promulgation equates to public awareness, citing Bentham's view that governments have a duty to educate citizens about the law. It calls for proactive communication of laws via local languages and mass media to ensure fairness and legitimacy in trade regulation.",
