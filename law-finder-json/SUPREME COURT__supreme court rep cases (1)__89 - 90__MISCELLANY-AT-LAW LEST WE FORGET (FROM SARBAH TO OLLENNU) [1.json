  "summary": "This 1989–90 Ghana Law Review article, 'Lest We Forget: From Sarbah to Ollennu,' authored by Mr. E.D. Kom, SAG, reflects on the historical contributions of prominent Ghanaian legal figures from the late 19th century to the late 20th century. It highlights John Mensah Sarbah as a pioneering lawyer, educationist, nationalist, and patriot who opposed colonial land legislation, notably the 1897 Lands Bill, and co-founded the Aborigines’ Rights Protection Society (ARPS). The article praises Sarbah’s selfless service, including his refusal of a 400-guinea fee, and his seminal works such as *Fanti Customary Laws*. It also honors other legal luminaries like J.E. Casely Hayford, Dr. J.B. Danquah, and Justice Nii Amaa Ollennu, emphasizing their roles in shaping Ghana’s legal and political landscape. The piece underscores the enduring legacy of lawyers in defending human rights, promoting education, and advancing nationalism, while lamenting contemporary attacks on the legal profession.",
