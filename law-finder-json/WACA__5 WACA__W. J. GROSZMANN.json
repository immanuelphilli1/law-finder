  "caseTitle": "W. J. GROSZMANN",
  "summary": "The West African Court of Appeal dismissed an application for leave to appeal to the Privy Council on the grounds that it was filed out of time. The appellant, O. S. Agyeman, sought leave to appeal in forma pauperis, but the Court reaffirmed its prior holding in Amelia Ahulu v. John Akotey that it lacked the authority to grant such leave. Furthermore, the Court stated that even if it had the power, the affidavit submitted did not provide sufficient grounds to exercise discretion in favor of the appellant. The application was therefore refused on both procedural and substantive grounds.",
