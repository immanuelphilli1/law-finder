  "caseTitle": "ARHIN VERSUS POBEE",
  "summary": "In Arhin v. Pobee, the plaintiff, Chief Kweku Arhin III, sued James Kobina Pobee for recovery of stool properties allegedly retained unlawfully. The key issue was whether the suit constituted a succession matter, which would determine the jurisdiction of the Municipal Court, Cape Coast. The court held that a suit relates to succession if the claimant must establish succession to a deceased native as a prerequisite to relief, regardless of whether succession was admitted. Relying on Vanderpuye v. Botchway and Hagan v. Adum, the court affirmed that the foundational nature of the claim—based on succession—classified the suit as one relating to succession, thereby falling within the unlimited jurisdiction of the trial court. The appeal, which argued the suit was personal due to an alleged admission of succession, was dismissed.",
