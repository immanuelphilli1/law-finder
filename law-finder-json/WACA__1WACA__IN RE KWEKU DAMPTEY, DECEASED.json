  "summary": "In Re Kweku Damptey, Deceased is a probate case concerning the right to administer the estate of a deceased man. The plaintiff, the nephew of the deceased, claimed entitlement under native customary law, while the defendant, the Omanhene of Kumawu, claimed based on the assertion that the deceased was an Ahinkwa who had been 'dashed' to his stool, thereby making his property the chief's. The West African Court of Appeal held that the custom of 'dashing' a person to a stool amounted to slavery, which is repugnant to justice, equity, and good conscience and therefore unenforceable under the Supreme Court Ordinance and the Slavery Abolition Act, 1883. The court set aside the lower court's decision and granted letters of administration to the plaintiff, recognizing his familial right to inherit in the absence of a valid slave-based claim.",
