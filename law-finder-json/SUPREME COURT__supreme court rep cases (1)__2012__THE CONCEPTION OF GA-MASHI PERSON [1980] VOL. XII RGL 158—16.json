  "caseTitle": "THE CONCEPTION OF GA-MASHI PERSON [1980] VOL. XII RGL 158—16",
  "summary": "This legal commentary critiques the erroneous judicial classification of Ga-Mashi people as matrilineal, arguing instead that their social organization is cognatic, with family membership and inheritance rights determined through the kpodziemo (naming ceremony). The author emphasizes that this ritual establishes the child's social fatherhood, ethnic identity as Ga, and affiliation with the paternal lineage, contradicting precedents like In re Larbi that place Ga-Mashi individuals in maternal families. Drawing on anthropological research by Azu, Kilson, and Field, and supported by case law such as the Accra Water Works case and Ankrah v. Odamtten, the article asserts that Ga-Mashi children are full members of their father's family, entitled to inheritance and status. The author calls for courts to abandon 'wooden adherence to precedent' and recognize the cultural centrality of the kpodziemo custom in determining Ga personal and family law.",
