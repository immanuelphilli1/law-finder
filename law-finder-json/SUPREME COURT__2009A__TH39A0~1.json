  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana, in a ruling delivered on 22nd July 2009, granted an application for certiorari to quash an interlocutory injunction issued by the Fast Track High Court, Accra, which had allowed private lotto operators to continue operations pending appeal. The Court held that the National Lotto Act, 2006 (Act 722) had lawfully prohibited private lotto operations after 30th March 2007, and that the High Court's injunction effectively granted a 'judicial licence' to operate illegally, thereby contravening statutory law. The Supreme Court emphasized that courts must uphold statutes and cannot authorize breaches of law, even through interim relief. The decision reaffirmed the principle that judicial discretion must operate within the bounds of statutory authority and constitutional order.",
