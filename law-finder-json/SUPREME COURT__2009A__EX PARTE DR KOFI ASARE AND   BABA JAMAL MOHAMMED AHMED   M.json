  "caseTitle": "EX PARTE DR KOFI ASARE AND BABA JAMAL MOHAMMED AHMED M",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana ruling addressed an application by Dr. Kofi Asare and Baba Jamal Mohammed Ahmed for a writ of certiorari to quash a High Court decision that allowed an election petition to proceed before the declaration and gazettal of parliamentary election results. The applicants argued the High Court lacked jurisdiction because the petition was premature under Article 99 and the Representation of the People Law, 1992 (PNDCL 284). The Court held that an election petition requires a declared result to identify 'the person whose election is questioned,' rendering the High Court action invalid as an election petition. However, it affirmed that courts, particularly the Supreme Court, retain jurisdiction to enforce constitutional rights during the electoral process, citing precedents like New Patriotic Party v. NDC. The ruling clarified that while election petitions must await results, constitutional enforcement actions can proceed earlier.",
