  "caseTitle": "Gladys Anane Addo & 9 v Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly , Kejet",
  "summary": "In this civil appeal before the Supreme Court of Ghana, the Kejetia Traders Association (Appellant) challenged the High Court and Court of Appeal decisions ordering it to render accounts for funds collected from members, including the Plaintiffs, to pre-finance the reconstruction of market stalls at Kejetia, Kumasi. The Plaintiffs, former licensees of the Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly (KMA), contributed significant sums to rebuild the market but were excluded from priority re-allocation. The High Court ruled that KMA alone had statutory authority to allocate stalls and ordered the Association to account for the funds, with audits by the Serious Fraud Office. The Supreme Court upheld this, finding that the High Court properly applied Order 33 Rule 3 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, despite the Appellant's claim that accounts should have been ordered earlier. The Court emphasized the Appellant's duty to account due to its fiduciary role and noted the lack of proper accounting records. The appeal was dismissed as without merit and potentially in bad faith, affirming the need for transparency and accountability in member-funded projects.",
