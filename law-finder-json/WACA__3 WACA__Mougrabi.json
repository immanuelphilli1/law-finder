  "summary": "This 1936 West Africa Court of Appeal decision in Mougrabi v. Mansour arose from an unlawful attachment of the plaintiff's goods in Kumasi. The Divisional Court had awarded the plaintiff �400 in special damages and �50 in general damages after finding the attachment illegal. The Appeal Court allowed the appeal, holding that the plaintiff was not entitled to the claimed special damages because no goods were missing, and that loss of reputation, treated as special damage, must be specifically pleaded and was not properly claimed. The court further ruled that loss of profits was due to a valid court injunction, not the defendant's unlawful act, and thus not compensable. The case was remitted for reassessment of general damages limited to �300, considering depreciation of goods and deprivation of use of property, with costs of the first trial to be taxed afresh.",
