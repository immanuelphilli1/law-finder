  "caseTitle": "OFOLEY SOLOMON",
  "summary": "This 1938 West African Court of Appeal case arose from a jurisdictional reference by the Divisional Court of the Eastern Province regarding a dispute over whether certain properties devised under the Will of William Adjabeng Solomon were family or self-acquired property. The plaintiff, Ofoley Solomon, sued as head of the Nee Adjabeng Ankrah family, seeking a declaration of title and an injunction against the executors and beneficiaries under the Will. Two defences emerged: one asserting the properties were self-acquired, and another challenging the plaintiff’s standing as head of the family. The trial judge questioned his jurisdiction under Section 48(2)(c) and (f) of the Native Administration Ordinance, which assigns such matters to Paramount Chief's Tribunals, and referred two questions to the West African Court of Appeal. The appellate court held that the mere existence of a Will does not automatically oust native tribunal jurisdiction; instead, jurisdiction depends on whether the nature of the transaction indicates the parties agreed—expressly or by implication—to be governed by English law. The final determination was left to the trial court to assess the facts accordingly.",
