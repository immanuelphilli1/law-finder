  "summary": "In Rex v Sala, Sat I, an appeal from a High Court murder conviction, the West Africa Court of Appeal upheld the decision despite the absence of the deceased's body. The appellants were convicted under section 319 of the Criminal Code for the murder of a child named Hardo. The court emphasized that while there was no direct evidence of the corpse, the circumstantial evidence pointing to the child's death was sufficiently strong to justify the conviction. The appellate judges—Kingdon C.J., Butler Lloyd, and Carey—held that such evidence met the required standard of proof, and therefore dismissed the appeals. The ruling underscores the legal principle that murder convictions can be sustained on compelling circumstantial evidence even when the corpus delicti is not physically established.",
