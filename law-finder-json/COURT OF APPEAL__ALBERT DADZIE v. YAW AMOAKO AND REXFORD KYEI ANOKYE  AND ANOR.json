  "caseTitle": "ALBERT DADZIE v. YAW AMOAKO AND REXFORD KYEI ANOKYE AND",
  "summary": "In this Court of Appeal case, the appellant (Albert Dadzie), a judgment creditor, appealed the High Court's decision favoring Rexford Kyei Anokye, who claimed ownership of property attached in execution of a judgment against Yaw Amoako. The High Court had ruled that the writ of execution had lapsed after one year under Order 42 rule 19 because it was 'unexecuted,' allowing the respondent to be a bona fide purchaser. The Court of Appeal reversed this, holding that the writ was no longer 'unexecuted' once the sheriff attached the property and initiated auction procedures within the initial year. Citing Order 43 rule 11, the Court emphasized that any alienation of attached property without court leave is null and void, irrespective of the purchaser's notice. The appeal was allowed, and the lower court's judgment was set aside.",
