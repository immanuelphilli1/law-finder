  "caseTitle": "OKAIKOR v OPARE AND MENSAH",
  "summary": "In Okai kor v Op are and Mensah, the plaintiff and her brother, C. A. Mensah, jointly owned a house in Accra, which was partitioned following a customary arbitration. After a prolonged dispute, the plaintiff performed the Ga customary rite of 'tako mli mfo' (severance of family ties) thirty years before her brother's death, cutting off all familial and inheritance rights. The brother's portion of the property was occupied by the defendant, who continued to pay rent to the brother’s son after the brother’s death. The plaintiff claimed possession, asserting sole inheritance rights. The court held that the partition validly created separate ownership and that the severance ritual barred the plaintiff from claiming any interest in her brother’s estate under Ga custom. As no reconciliation occurred before or after death, the plaintiff had no succession rights. Judgment was entered for the defendants.",
