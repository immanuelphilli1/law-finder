  "summary": "In Edith Amorkor Sykes & Ors. v. The Good Shepherd Mission (CA 32/1997), the Court of Appeal dismissed the appellant's appeal challenging the refusal of a stay of proceedings in favor of arbitration. The respondents, property owners, had leased their premises to the appellant mission for 21 years with development obligations, but terminated the lease after six months, alleging fraudulent misrepresentation by the appellant's agent. They later sued for possession, damages for deceit, and mesne profits. The appellant sought a stay of proceedings and referral to arbitration under a clause in the lease. The Court of Appeal held that while Section 8 of the Arbitration Act, Act 38 imposes no strict time limit for such applications, timeliness and risk of waiver are fact-sensitive. It found the appellant had not waived its right to arbitration by filing a defence and additional issues, having clearly objected to the court's jurisdiction in paragraph 30 of the defence. However, the court upheld the trial judge's refusal to stay proceedings because the respondents had pleaded fraud with sufficient particularity under Section 27(b) of the Act, which vitiates the entire agreement, including the arbitration clause. Thus, the court properly assumed jurisdiction to adjudicate the foundational validity of the contract.",
