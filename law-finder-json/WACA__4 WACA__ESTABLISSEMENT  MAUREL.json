  "caseTitle": "ESTABLISSEMENT MAUREL",
  "summary": "This case involved a dispute over title to land at 50 Dobson Street, Bathurst, Gambia, following a mortgage executed by Musa M'Boob, who held the property as trustee for a group of beneficiaries under a 1928 Crown grant. That grant included a covenant requiring government consent for any assignment and a proviso allowing re-entry upon breach. In 1936, M'Boob executed a legal mortgage to Establissements Maurel et Prom without obtaining the required consent. The Gambian government declared the grant forfeited, cancelled the duplicate, and later re-granted the land to the original beneficiaries. The mortgagee sought to sell the property, but the court held the mortgage void due to the breach of covenant and lack of consent. The court upheld the validity of restraints on alienation in Crown land grants under the Public Lands (Grants and Dispositions) Ordinance, 1902, distinguishing colonial law from English common law. Re-entry by the government was found through official communications and the subsequent re-grant. While estoppel bound M'Boob due to a prior court order, it did not affect the rights of the other beneficiaries who were not parties to those proceedings.",
