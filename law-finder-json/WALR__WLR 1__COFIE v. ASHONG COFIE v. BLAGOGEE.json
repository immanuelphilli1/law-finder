  "caseTitle": "COFIE VERSUS BLAGOGEE.",
  "summary": "The case involves a dispute over land in the 'Brazilian' quarter of Accra, Ghana, where the plaintiff, Cofie, claimed ownership through his father, Cofie Congo, who was granted the land by the Ga Mantse and occupied it for decades. The defendants, Ashong and Blagogee, claimed title via purchase from Nii Azuma III, Head of the Brazilian Community. The court held that the Head lacked authority to transfer 'Brazilian' family lands, as ownership rests with individual families, not the community head. The plaintiff’s long, uninterrupted possession following an original grant established a valid usufructuary title under native law. The plea of estoppel based on non-intervention in prior litigation failed, as mere non-participation does not constitute fraudulent acquiescence. The plaintiff’s claim was upheld, and the defendants’ titles declared invalid.",
