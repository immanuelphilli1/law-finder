  "summary": "In John Dominic Owusu v. Akua Adoma (CA 40/2000, 7 June 2001), the Court of Appeal of Ghana reviewed a property dispute where the plaintiff claimed ownership of House No. 30 Block K, Kaasi, Kumasi, based on a written deed of assignment dated 6 July 1987. The trial court found that the deed (Exhibit A) was not executed by the defendant and was fraudulent, yet granted specific performance to the plaintiff based on part performance under equity. The Court of Appeal overturned this, holding that the plaintiff failed to prove a valid written contract and had not fulfilled the full purchase price of ₵4 million, having paid only ₵2.9 million. The court emphasized that time was of the essence in the agreement, as stipulated by the defendant and unrefuted by credible evidence. It concluded that the trial court erred in granting specific performance despite the lack of writing and incomplete payment, and that the plaintiff's reliance on a forged document undermined his case. The appeal was allowed, and judgment was entered for the defendant.",
