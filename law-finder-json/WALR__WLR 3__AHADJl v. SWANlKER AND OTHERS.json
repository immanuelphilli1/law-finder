  "caseTitle": "AHADJ VERSUS SWAN",
  "summary": "In this 1958 Ghanaian land case, the plaintiff advanced an unsecured, interest-free loan of \u0001267 to the late Hansen Peter Swaniker in January 1956, conditional on his promise to convey his house to her if he failed to repay within two months. When Swaniker defaulted, he conveyed the property to the plaintiff in March 1956 via a deed appearing as an outright alienation. Swaniker remained in possession and leased parts of the house without the plaintiff's consent. After his death, his family, represented by the first defendant, contested the conveyance, arguing it was a mortgage rather than a sale. The court, per Ollennu J, held that the transaction was an outright sale, not a mortgage, emphasizing the absence of mutuality of rights typical of mortgages, the lack of interest, and the fact that the conveyance followed a prior agreement. The court relied on Tapply v. Sheather and other authorities to conclude that an unsecured loan with a promise to convey upon default constitutes a vendor-purchaser relationship. The plaintiff's evidence was found credible and sufficient to prove ownership, while the defendants' evidence was rejected as inconclusive and evasive. Judgment was entered for the plaintiff.",
