  "caseTitle": "SARFO VERSUS BONSU",
  "summary": "In Sarfo v. Bonsu, a dispute arose between two Ghanaian stools over land ownership within a timber concession area. Both parties, along with two other stools, jointly granted a concession to A. Lang & Co. Ltd., with the plaintiff receiving 5% of the rent. The plaintiff sought a revision of this share after boundary demarcation, but the defendant refused, leading to litigation. The plaintiff argued that the defendant was estopped from denying his interest in the land due to their joint execution of the lease and the defendant's agreement to let the plaintiff prove the grant in court. The Court of Appeal held that no estoppel arose either by deed or conduct, as the lease was executed conditionally and did not bind the lessors inter se. The court emphasized that recitals in a deed among joint grantors do not create binding admissions between them, and conduct in facilitating proof of the grant created at most a rebuttable presumption, not an estoppel. The appeal was dismissed, upholding the lower courts' findings on ownership.",
