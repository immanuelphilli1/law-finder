  "caseTitle": "COMMISSIONER OF POLICE VERSUS WOOD.",
  "summary": "The West African Court of Appeal set aside the summary conviction of Police Constable Wood for perjury under Section 149 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1951. The Senior Magistrate had convicted Wood summarily after he testified that Addy was not driving during a traffic offense trial, which contradicted the magistrate's finding. However, the appellate court held that the record failed to show that Wood was informed of the specific substance of the perjury allegation or that he was given a chance to show cause why he should not be punished. Citing Chang Hang Kiu v. Piggot and Another, the court reaffirmed that even in summary perjury proceedings, the accused must be clearly informed of the gist of the accusation and allowed to respond. The absence of these elements in the record violated fundamental principles of criminal justice, rendering the conviction invalid. The appeal was allowed, and the appellant was discharged.",
