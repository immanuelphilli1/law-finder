  "summary": "This 2007 Supreme Court of Ghana judgment in Nana Kofi Owusu v Kwaku Owusu Ansah & Baffour Appiah Dankwa concerns a land dispute over Twedie lands designated as Durbar Grounds. The High Court had granted an interim injunction to preserve the status quo, which the Court of Appeal overturned, finding the plaintiff had a stronger claim based on historical arbitrations favoring Toasehene's ownership. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision, ruling that the trial judge misapplied facts by citing non-existent pending litigation and failed to properly assess pleadings and affidavits. The court emphasized that interim injunctions must be based on a serious question to be tried and balanced hardship, concluding the plaintiff would suffer greater harm if development of communal land was restrained. The judgment also highlighted the importance of environmental and communal land conservation.",
