  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision in Civil Appeal No. J4/3/2011, delivered on 27th July 2011, concerned an appeal against contempt convictions arising from a chieftaincy dispute over the enstoolment of the Akwamuhene of Agogo Traditional Area. The respondent, Kwaku Amponsah, initiated contempt proceedings after the first appellant was enstooled during ongoing chieftaincy litigation. The High Court convicted the appellants, a decision upheld by the Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, setting aside the convictions and sentences. It held that contempt being quasi-criminal requires proof beyond reasonable doubt, and the affidavit evidence presented was insufficient to meet this standard, particularly in the face of denial by the respondents. The court emphasized that the applicant failed to adduce further evidence or seek cross-examination, leaving the matter as a mere assertion versus denial, entitling the respondents to the benefit of the doubt.",
