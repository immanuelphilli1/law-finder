  "summary": "In this appeal from a Circuit Court decision, Afua Oforiwaa challenged the award of only a one-third share of the matrimonial home (No. D40 Abeka Lapaz) following the dissolution of her customary marriage to Paul K. Adu. The Court of Appeal held that despite a deed of gift (Exhibit 7) naming only the husband as the recipient, the property was acquired during the subsistence of the marriage and financed through a common fund derived from joint earnings in the UK and shared business ventures in Ghana. The court emphasized that both parties contributed to the family's financial well-being, with the wife working as a seamstress and cleaner and managing the household and children. Citing Article 22(3) of the 1992 Constitution and precedents such as Abebreseh v Kaah and Domfe v Adu, the Court ruled that the wife was entitled to an equal share in the matrimonial property. The appeal was allowed, and the cross-appeal dismissed due to lack of written submissions.",
