  "caseTitle": "THE SCOPE OF THE RIGHT OF TESTATION AND INCIDENTS OF THE GA",
  "summary": "This legal commentary examines the Ga six-cloth marriage in Ghana and its profound impact on the right of testation. It argues that this indigenous institution inherently limits a man's freedom to dispose of his property by will when he has children from a six-cloth marriage, due to the customary rights of permanent dependency, hereditary office succession, and family estate inclusion vested in such offspring. The article highlights that these children have indefeasible rights to enjoy family resources during life and pass them on, which cannot be defeated by will. Similarly, the six-cloth wife enjoys social prestige, security, and restricted autonomy, including limitations on divorce and remarriage, and is subject to levirate customs. The piece critiques past judicial disregard of these customary norms and calls for legal recognition of the six-cloth marriage as a robust institution that predates and parallels English family provision laws.",
