  "summary": "This legal commentary discusses the admissibility of confession statements in criminal cases in Ghana, focusing on the precedent set in R. v. Abisa Grunshie, which recommended the presence of an independent civilian witness during the recording of confessions, especially in murder cases. However, in Gyedu v. The Republic, the Court of Appeal clarified that this requirement is a rule of practice, not a binding legal rule. The court acknowledged the practical challenges in rural or illiterate communities where finding literate, independent witnesses is difficult. It upheld the admissibility of confessions even without such witnesses, provided the statements were voluntary. The decision promotes judicial realism and flexibility in evidentiary procedures.",
