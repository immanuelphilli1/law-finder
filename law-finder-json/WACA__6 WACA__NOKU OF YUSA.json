  "caseTitle": "NOKU OF YUSA",
  "summary": "The appellant, Noku of Yusa, was initially acquitted of the murder of Ayir due to insufficient evidence linking his actions to the victim's death. Subsequently, he was charged and convicted of committing an act intended to cause grievous harm under section 332(1) of the Criminal Code, based on the same underlying acts. He appealed, arguing that the conviction violated the principle of 'autrefois acquit' since he had already been acquitted on the murder charge. The West Africa Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that because the murder charge required proof of unlawful killing—which was not established—the accused was never in jeopardy for the lesser offense of causing grievous harm during the first trial. Therefore, the plea of 'autrefois acquit' could not succeed. The court clarified that the identity of facts alone does not bar a subsequent prosecution; rather, the key test is whether the first acquittal necessarily involved an acquittal on the second charge. Since it did not, the conviction was upheld.",
