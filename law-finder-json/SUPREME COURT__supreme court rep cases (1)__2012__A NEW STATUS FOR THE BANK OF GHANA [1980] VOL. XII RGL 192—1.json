  "caseTitle": "A NEW STATUS FOR THE BANK OF GHANA [1980] VOL. XII RGL 192—1",
  "summary": "This legal commentary analyzes Article 146(1) of the 1979 Constitution of Ghana, which directs the Bank of Ghana to operate as a central bank. The author concludes that the provision does not create a new status but constitutionally entrenches an existing one established under the 1957 Ordinance and continued under the 1963 Bank of Ghana Act (Act 182). While the Bank already performed core central banking functions—such as currency issuance, credit regulation, and monetary stability—the constitutional recognition strengthens its institutional autonomy and permanence. The article examines whether the Bank's direct involvement in foreign exchange transactions and credit operations with individuals conflicts with its central banking role, arguing that such flexibility may be necessary in a developing economy. The author emphasizes that central bank functions are shaped by national context and that the Bank's wide statutory powers under Act 182 remain consistent with its role, provided they are exercised judiciously to avoid competing unfairly with commercial banks.",
