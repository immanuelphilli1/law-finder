  "summary": "This document is a judicial address delivered by Chief Justice Sowah E. N. P. on the principles and best practices for writing court judgments in Ghana. Emphasizing that judgment delivery is the most important judicial function, the CJ outlines key aspects including the necessity of mastering the English language, adopting a clear and effective writing style, properly settling issues before trial, and accurately applying the law. He stresses that judgments must be clear, concise, and based on a proper evaluation of evidence rather than witness demeanour. The speech highlights the binding nature of precedent under stare decisis, the importance of legal research despite limited access to law reports, and the need for judges to avoid verbosity and ambiguity. The CJ also cautions against improper cross-examination tactics and premature rulings on the merits before evidence is heard.",
