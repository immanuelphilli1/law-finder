  "summary": "This document records speeches delivered at the 1989 annual durbar of attorneys in Ghana, organized by the Attorney-General. Deputy Secretary for Justice Martin A.B.K. Amidu delivered a critical address emphasizing the role of government attorneys in supporting national economic recovery and social transformation. He stressed that legal professionals must align with state policy objectives, maintain high standards of legal drafting and research, and uphold ethical and professional rigor. Amidu highlighted systemic challenges including inadequate resources, poor legal pleadings (e.g., misuse of prerogative writs in civil claims), and the decline of mentorship for junior attorneys. He advocated for the revival of structured training, implementation of continuing legal education, and periodic performance assessments to restore professional excellence within the Ministry of Justice.",
