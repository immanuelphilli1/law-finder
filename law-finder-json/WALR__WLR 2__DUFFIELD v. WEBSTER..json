  "caseTitle": "DUFFIELD VERSUS WEBSTER.",
  "summary": "In this 1956 libel action before the Supreme Court of the Colony of the Gambia, the defendant successfully applied for a stay of proceedings on grounds that the action was frivolous, vexatious, and an abuse of court process. The plaintiff based his claim on a letter dated February 8, 1956, which he had not seen and whose contents he learned secondhand. The defendant swore in an uncontradicted affidavit that no letter was written on that date and that the actual letter, written on another day, did not contain the words alleged. The court held that a libel action cannot proceed without the plaintiff having reasonable certainty of the defamatory words, and that attempting to use litigation as a means to obtain evidence constitutes an abuse of process. Relying on Collins v. Jones and other authorities, the court found the plaintiff's claim amounted to a fishing expedition and granted a stay with costs.",
