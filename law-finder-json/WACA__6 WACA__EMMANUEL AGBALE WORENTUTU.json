  "summary": "This is an appeal against sentencing heard by the West African Court of Appeal on October 16, 1940, involving two appellants, Emmanuel Agbale Worentutu and Salami Adebessin (co-appellant), who were convicted in the High Court of Ibadan Division on two counts: burglary and stealing under Sections 411(1) and 390(4)(b) of the Criminal Code, and robbery under Section 402 of the Criminal Code. The original sentences—10 and 6 years for the first appellant, and 8 and 4 years for the second, all concurrently—were deemed insufficient. The appellate court, citing the appellants' membership in an armed criminal gang and the first appellant's prior violent offenses, exercised its authority to enhance the sentences. The revised sentences were set at 15 and 9 years for the first appellant, and 12 and 6 years for the second, all to run concurrently, in the interest of public protection.",
