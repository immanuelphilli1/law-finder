  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana, in Ransford France v. Electoral Commission & Attorney-General (Writ No. J1/19/2012, 19 October 2012), addressed whether the Electoral Commission (EC) violated constitutional provisions by creating new parliamentary constituencies through the Representation of the People (Parliamentary Constituencies) Instrument, 2012 (C.I. 78) without first publishing regulations governing such discretion under Article 296(c) of the 1992 Constitution. The plaintiff sought declarations and injunctions asserting that the EC’s failure to issue regulatory guidelines breached constitutional requirements and fundamental voting rights. The Court held that it had jurisdiction under Article 2(1) and Article 130(1) to adjudicate on the constitutional validity of C.I. 78, distinguishing this case from prior rulings like Bortier, where boundary demarcation disputes were referred to a tribunal under Article 48. However, the Court declined to invalidate C.I. 78, interpreting Article 296(c) not as an absolute precondition for exercising discretion but as a directive principle aimed at ensuring fairness and transparency. It emphasized that a literal interpretation requiring prior regulations would destabilize administrative governance and invalidate numerous past executive actions. Thus, while affirming constitutional oversight, the Court upheld the validity of C.I. 78.",
