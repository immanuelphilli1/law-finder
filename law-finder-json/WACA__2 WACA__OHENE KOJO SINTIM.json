  "caseTitle": "OHENE KOJO SINTIM",
  "summary": "This case involved a dispute over the sale of land by a sub-chief (Odikro) of Akroso without the knowledge or consent of the plaintiff-appellant, Ohene Kojo Sintim, the Divisional Chief of Mansu and overlord under native law. The plaintiff sought to set aside the sale and obtain an injunction to prevent interference with possession. The West Africa Court of Appeal held that under established native custom, no land subject to a dominant stool can be alienated without the overlord's consent. The court ruled that the onus of proving such consent rested with the defendants (purchasers), who failed to discharge it. Key deficiencies included lack of accredited agents from the dominant stool at the sale, absence of the overlord's signature on the receipt (which was issued four years later), and no formal conveyance of the land. The appeal was allowed, the lower court's judgment reversed, and the original decision of the Native Tribunal restored.",
