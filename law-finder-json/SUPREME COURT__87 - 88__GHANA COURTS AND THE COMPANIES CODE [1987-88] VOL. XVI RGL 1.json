  "summary": "This article by Mills J.E.A. examines the development and judicial interpretation of the Companies Code, 1963 (Act 179) in Ghana. It highlights the historical origins of the Code, rooted in Professor LCB Gower's recommendations following a thorough review of existing company laws and African legal systems. The Code was designed to modernize Ghana's corporate legal framework, departing from outdated English statutes while preserving familiar common law principles. Key innovations include the introduction of one-man companies, combination of the Memorandum and Articles into 'Regulations', no-par value shares, and ratification of pre-incorporation contracts. The article emphasizes the role of Ghanaian courts in developing case law to complement the statutory framework, noting that judicial decisions are essential to give 'flesh' to the 'skeleton' of the Code. It also discusses the legal status of Gower’s Final Report as a tool for statutory interpretation, though not legally binding, and underscores the importance of adapting company law to local economic and social conditions.",
