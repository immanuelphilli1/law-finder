  "caseTitle": "AMUEL Q. NELSON",
  "summary": "This civil appeal before the West Africa Court of Appeal arose from a trespass claim by Samuel Q. Nelson against S. Ammah and Yawa Aruna regarding possession of land originally belonging to the Aruna family. The plaintiff claimed he purchased the land in 1920 from Isaac Cobblah Fiscian, head of the Aruna family, and entered into possession. The defendants argued they had superior title. The Ga Tribunal and Provincial Commissioner dismissed the appeal, relying on Exhibits 'B', 'C', and 'F' to support Yawa Aruna's status as family head and rightful heir. The appellate court found serious misdirections: Exhibit 'B' (1934) could not retroactively validate pre-1930 transactions; Exhibit 'C' (1931) did not adjudicate family headship; and Exhibit 'F' applied inapplicable Cape Coast succession law. The court emphasized that blood relatives existed, Ga customary law governed, and the plaintiff was not required to join Fiscian. The case was remitted for re-hearing de novo with proper directions on the exhibits and native law.",
