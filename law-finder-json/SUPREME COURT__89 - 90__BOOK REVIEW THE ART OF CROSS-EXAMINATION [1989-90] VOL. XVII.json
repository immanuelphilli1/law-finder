  "summary": "This document is a book review of two legal publications by Nat Heward-Mills: 'The Art of Cross-Examination' (1988) and its companion, 'A Handbook of Cross-Examination' (1991). The review, authored by Bimpong-Buta S.Y., highlights the content, structure, and practical value of both works in enhancing advocacy skills, particularly in cross-examination. The books emphasize thorough preparation, strategic questioning, and mastery of evidence law, especially Ghana's Evidence Decree, 1972 (NRCD 323). The author draws from personal courtroom experience, illustrating techniques with real case examples. Both books were formally launched at notable legal institutions in Ghana and received commendations from Supreme Court justices. While the first book lacks a subject index, this is remedied in the second. The review praises the clarity, practicality, and instructional value of the works for both novice and experienced lawyers in common law jurisdictions.",
