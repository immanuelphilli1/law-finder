  "caseTitle": "ABUSATU BALOGUN",
  "summary": "This case concerns the interpretation of the will of Alli Balogun, a wealthy Lagosian trader, who died in 1933. The central issue was whether the executors were justified in paying a monthly allowance of \u000110 to the testator's eldest son, Busari Balogun, as head of the family, under native Yoruba law and custom. The plaintiffs, daughters of the testator, challenged these payments as unauthorized by the will. The West African Court of Appeal held that although the will did not explicitly authorize such payments, there was an implied authority based on customary obligations requiring the head of the family to maintain the family house, host ceremonies, support dependents, and provide hospitality. The court found that the executors acted within their discretion in making the allowance, guided by native custom, which must be respected under Section 20 of Chapter 3. While Aitken, J. dissented on the merits of the implied authority, the majority upheld the practice. On costs, the court unanimously ruled that the appellants were entitled to costs in the lower court from the estate, and both parties were awarded solicitor-and-client costs in the appeal, also payable from the estate.",
