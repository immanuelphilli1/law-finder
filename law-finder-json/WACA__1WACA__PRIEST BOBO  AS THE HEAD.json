  "caseTitle": "PRIEST BOBO AS THE HEAD",
  "summary": "This West African Court of Appeal case arose from a land dispute over mortgaged creeks (Akporlor, Agbiwe, Zukpewe, and Mosuoe) adjacent to the Avu Lagoon in Avenor, Ghana. The plaintiffs, led by Priest Bobo and ToGbri Sri II, claimed ownership as tribal property of the Avenor nation. The defendant, Timothy A. Anthony, had purchased the land at execution following a mortgage by three individuals claiming to be Fias of Avenor. The trial court and appellate court held that the mortgagors lacked authority to convey title, as the land was tribal property and the government-recognized Fia at the time was Anuma II. The Benibi v. Bobo (1924) decision was pivotal, having established the lagoon and creeks as perpetual property of the Sevie Tribe, later interpreted as belonging to the broader Avenor nation. The court upheld the trial judge's discretion to allow amendments to the writ during proceedings, rejecting claims of misjoinder and estoppel. Although Anthony was an innocent purchaser, he acquired no valid title. The plaintiffs succeeded in reclaiming the land, though costs were denied due to their failure to intervene earlier.",
