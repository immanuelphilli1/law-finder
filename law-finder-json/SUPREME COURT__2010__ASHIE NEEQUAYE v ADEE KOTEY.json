  "summary": "In Ashie Neequaye v Adee Kotey, the Supreme Court of Ghana upheld the plaintiff's right to relitigate a property dispute after securing Letters of Administration for the estate of Moses Neequaye. The earlier dismissal of the claim due to lack of capacity did not constitute res judicata, as it did not address the merits. The court found that the plaintiff now had proper standing, rejecting the defendant's arguments on res judicata, lack of capacity, and statute-barred claims. It held that the property originally belonged to Moses Neequaye, was held in trust by Dina Neequaye, and remained part of his estate. The defendant lacked locus standi to challenge the administration of Dina’s estate. The limitation period was not triggered as no adverse claim arose during Moses Neequaye’s lifetime. The decision affirmed the concurrent findings of the lower courts.",
