  "summary": "This document is a memorial tribute published in the Review of Ghana Law (1980) honoring the late Mr. Justice Edward Akufo-Addo, M.O.V., Hon. LL.D. (Oxon.), former Chief Justice and President of Ghana, who passed away on 17 July 1979. The tribute, delivered at a solemn ceremony on 5 May 1980, highlights his distinguished career as a lawyer, judge, statesman, and founding member of the United Gold Coast Convention. Akufo-Addo was called to the Bar in 1940 and rose to the Supreme Court in 1962, bypassing the High Court, a historic appointment. He served as Chief Justice from 1966 to 1970 and later as President of the Second Republic from 1970 until the 1972 coup. He was instrumental in chairing the 1967 Constitutional Commission and drafting the 1969 Constitution, which granted full autonomy to the judiciary—a legacy preserved in later constitutions. Known for his eloquence, moral integrity, and firm judicial demeanor, he was respected and sometimes feared on the bench. The tribute underscores his contributions to law, governance, and national development, and expresses deep national loss at his passing.",
