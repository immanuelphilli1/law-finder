  "caseTitle": "GIHOC REFRIGERATION & HOUSEHOLD v JEAN HANNA ASSI",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana civil appeal arose from a land ownership dispute over Plot No. 19, Ring Road Industrial Area, Kaneshie, Accra. The Respondent, Jean Hanna Assi, claimed ownership of the land, supported by Land Title Certificate No. GA 8570, and argued that although his company, General Cold Industry Ltd., was confiscated in 1979 and 1982, the land itself was never legally confiscated. The Appellant, GIHOC Refrigeration & Household Products Ltd., claimed adverse possession. The trial judge found for the Respondent, declaring his title indefeasible under PNDCL 152. While the majority dismissed the substantive appeal, Justice Akuffo (dissenting on the cross-appeal) held that the trial court had jurisdiction to grant a declaration of title and recovery of possession even without a formal counterclaim, citing Order 63 Rule 6 of the old Civil Procedure Rules and the modern emphasis on achieving substantive justice under C.I. 47. She argued that requiring a separate action would cause unnecessary expense and multiplicity of proceedings, contrary to judicial reform goals.",
