  "summary": "In Toku v. Adukorang and Others, the plaintiff, recognized as Nkwakwahene (leader of young men) in Nyenasi, sought reimbursement of pacification payments and damages after defendants refused to recognize him following a prior dispute over political support in a local council bye-election. The High Court held that the customary arbitration, which resolved the immediate conflict through apology and pacification, did not bind the defendants to future recognition. The court found no legal or contractual basis for an enforceable obligation to recognize the plaintiff, noting that the Nkwakwahene held no formal legal status in Twifu State. Thus, the refusal to recognize him did not constitute a breach of legal duty, and no cause of action for damages or refund arose. The appeal was dismissed.",
