  "summary": "In this unreported ruling, Dr. Date-Bah, J.S.C., sitting as a single justice of the Ghanaian Supreme Court, dismissed a motion by Ashanti Goldfields Company Ltd (now AngloGold Ashanti Ghana Ltd) seeking to restrain enforcement of a judgment debt pending appeal. The applicant sought orders to keep $4 million in court investment, allow retention of $1 million by each plaintiff, and prevent enforcement of the balance of the judgment. The core issue was jurisdiction: the Supreme Court held it lacked authority to hear the application because the record of appeal had not yet been transmitted from the lower court. Relying on Rule 16(1) of CI 16 and the precedent in Ampong v Frempong [1965] GLR 350, the Court ruled that jurisdiction over interlocutory matters vests only after transmission of the record. The applicant's reliance on the Court's 'ample powers' and cases like Merchant Bank Ghana Ltd v Similar Ways Ltd was rejected as inapplicable, particularly since no nullity or supervisory jurisdiction was involved. The motion was thus struck out for lack of jurisdiction.",
