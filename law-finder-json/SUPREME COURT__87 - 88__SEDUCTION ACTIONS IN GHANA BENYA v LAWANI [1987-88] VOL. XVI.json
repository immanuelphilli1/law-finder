  "caseTitle": "BENYA v LAWANI",
  "summary": "The article examines the legal concept of seduction in Ghanaian law, focusing on the case of Benya v Lawani [1987-88], where a father sued a medical officer for the seduction of his未成年 daughter, resulting in pregnancy. The trial court awarded substantial damages under 'customary seduction' without clarifying the legal basis or elements of the claim. The author critiques the confusion between common law and customary law principles, noting that while common law seduction requires proof of loss of service (master-servant relationship), customary law focuses on the wrong done to the unmarried woman and the disgrace brought upon her family. The article highlights that customary seduction does not hinge on loss of service but on inducement leading to departure from the home and resulting social harm. It further distinguishes between seduction of married and unmarried women under customary law, with the former involving quasi-criminal penalties like 'Brabbu' paid to the husband, reflecting public disapproval. The author calls for clarity in distinguishing between enticement, seduction, and customary practices to prevent judicial confusion and ensure proper application of legal principles.",
