  "summary": "This case involved a boundary dispute between the plaintiff-appellant, Adokwaihene Kwesi I Brantuo, and the defendant-respondent, Amoafulhene Kwarrna Poku, over land known as Nkwantanan. The dispute centered on the correct interpretation of a 1907 boundary demarcation by Captain Armitage between Bekwai (plaintiff's stool land) and Adansi (defendant's stool land). The native tribunal initially ruled for the defendant, but the Court of the Chief Commissioner reversed that decision, finding the native tribunal’s conclusion to be plainly wrong. The West Africa Court of Appeal, by majority, affirmed the Chief Commissioner’s judgment. The key issue was whether the boundary followed the path from Jidiedema to Meduma after crossing the Agugu River, as per Captain Armitage’s description, or diverged along the Kukra stream. The appellate court held that the original demarcation clearly indicated the path as the boundary, supported by the placement of boundary pillars at directional changes. The absence of any pillar where the boundary would have turned from the Kukra stream to the Meduma path undermined the respondent’s claim. The court emphasized that while native tribunals have primary jurisdiction over customary land matters, appellate courts may reverse factual findings when they are demonstrably incorrect. A declaration was issued confirming the boundary along the yellow line on Exhibit D, aligning with Captain Armitage’s demarcation.",
