  "caseTitle": "P.S. INVESTMENT LIMITED V CENTRAL REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT",
  "summary": "P.S. Investment Limited, a minority shareholder in Twifo Oil Palm Plantation Limited (TOPP), brought an action against CEREDEC (the majority shareholder), Unilever Ghana Limited, the Divestiture Implementation Committee (DIC), the Attorney General, and several directors, challenging the sale of 40% of CEREDEC's shares in TOPP to Unilever. The plaintiff alleged violations of its pre-emptive rights under Regulation 32(a) of TOPP’s regulations, arguing that the sale was conducted by DIC without proper authority and bypassed shareholder consent. The trial court dismissed all claims, but the case was appealed to the Supreme Court. Central issues included whether the DIC had the power to sell CEREDEC’s shares, whether board resolutions approving the transfer were valid, and whether directors acted in bad faith. The case highlights key principles of corporate governance, shareholder rights, and the limits of state agencies in divestiture processes under Ghanaian company law.",
