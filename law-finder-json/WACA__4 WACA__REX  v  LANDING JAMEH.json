  "caseTitle": "REX v LANDING JAMEH",
  "summary": "The appellant, Landing Jameh, a Chief Driver in the Public Works Department of the Gambia Government, was convicted of stealing ten cases of government petrol under section 255 of the Criminal Code (theft by person in public service). The trial occurred in the Provincial Court of South Bank Province, though the initial act occurred in Bathurst. The appellant challenged jurisdiction, arguing the theft occurred solely in Bathurst, but the court held the offence was continuing and thus triable in the South Bank Province under section 61 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The appellant also sought to introduce further evidence on appeal, including testimony suggesting no petrol shortage was found, but the appellate court refused, noting such evidence pertained to facts, not law, and was inadmissible on a legal appeal. The court also rejected claims of procedural irregularity due to the absence of counsel, finding the trial judge exercised discretion appropriately. Finally, the court held that the prosecution established a prima facie case through circumstantial evidence, even without direct proof of petrol loss, citing Rex v. Mockford. The appeal was dismissed.",
