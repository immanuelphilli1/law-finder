  "caseTitle": "MUBASHIH.U AIYEPOLA v COMMISSIONER OF POLICE",
  "summary": "The appellant was convicted in the Magistrate's Court for an offence under section 516 of the Criminal Code, which required his consent for trial at that level. The Magistrate failed to obtain this consent, rendering the trial a nullity for lack of jurisdiction under section 20(iv) of the Magistrates' Courts Ordinance. On appeal, the Supreme Court declared the trial void and ordered a re-trial. The appellant challenged this, arguing that a re-trial could only follow a reversed finding and sentence, not a trial void ab initio. The West African Court of Appeal upheld the re-trial order, relying on Commissioner of Police v. Ayiku, holding that where a trial is null due to lack of jurisdiction, the appellate court may reverse the finding and sentence as part of the void proceedings and then order a re-trial under section 43(a)(i) of the Magistrates' Courts (Appeals) Ordinance. The court rejected the notion of inherent powers, affirming that appellate authority is strictly statutory.",
