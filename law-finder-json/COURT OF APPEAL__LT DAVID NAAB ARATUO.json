  "caseTitle": "LT DAVID NAAB ARATUO",
  "summary": "The appellant, Kingsford Amoah alias Kwame Abaka, was jointly tried with Yaw Duodu in the High Court, Cape Coast, for conspiracy to commit robbery and robbery under Sections 23(1) and 149 of the Criminal Offences Act, 1960 (Act 29), as amended by Act 646 of 2003. Both were convicted and sentenced to 40 years' imprisonment, to run concurrently. The facts showed that on June 29, 2007, the accused, posing as customers, hired a Tico taxi driven by the deceased, directed him to Kromanmu, and later lured him into the bush near Mando where they inflicted fatal knife wounds, stole the vehicle and GH¢12,000, and fled to Accra. They were arrested while attempting to sell the taxi. The Court of Appeal, in reviewing the evidence de novo, found that the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused conspired and committed robbery using offensive weapons (knives). Witness testimony, including from PW2 to PW7, was consistent and corroborative. The alibi defence was rejected as implausible and an afterthought. The appeal was dismissed, and the conviction and sentence were affirmed.",
