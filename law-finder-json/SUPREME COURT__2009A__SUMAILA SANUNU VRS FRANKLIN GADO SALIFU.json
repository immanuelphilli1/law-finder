  "caseTitle": "SUMAILA SANUNU VRS FRANKLIN GADO SALIFU",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana allowed the appeal in Sumaila Sanunu v. Franklin Gado Salifu, overturning both the High Court's grant of summary judgment and the Court of Appeal's affirmation. The appellant, a contractor, had entered a joint execution agreement with the respondent to complete a Ghana Telecom project, with the respondent claiming full financial responsibility. A promissory note, not mentioned in the statement of claim but submitted during the summary judgment application, formed the basis of the lower courts' decisions. The Supreme Court held that the failure to plead reliance on the promissory note deprived the appellant of fair notice. Additionally, the appellant raised triable issues, including that the agreement was with his company (a separate legal entity) and that the document was signed under duress. The Court emphasized that the existence of any bona fide defence requires a full trial, and thus remitted the case for trial on the merits.",
