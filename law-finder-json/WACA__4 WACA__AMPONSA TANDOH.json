  "caseTitle": "AMPONSA TANDOH",
  "summary": "This 1938 West Africa Court of Appeal decision arose from a land dispute in New Juaben, Ghana, where Amponsa Tandoh (plaintiff) claimed possession, an account of cocoa farm proceeds, and an injunction against Kwadjo Sarfo (defendant), alleging his brother sold the land without consent. The Native Tribunal found Tandoh had acquiesced to the sale by accepting £2 8s. as 'thanksgiving' in 1921, thus losing his right to sue under native customary law. The Provincial Commissioner reversed this, but the Appeal Court held that the Native Tribunal's findings—based on customary practices like oath proofing and acquiescence—should not be disturbed absent clear error, citing Abaka Nthah v. Anguah Bennieh. The appeal was allowed, the lower court's judgment set aside, and the Native Tribunal's decision restored.",
