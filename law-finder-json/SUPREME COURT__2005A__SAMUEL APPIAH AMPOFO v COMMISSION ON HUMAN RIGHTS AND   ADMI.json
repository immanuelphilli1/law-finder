  "caseTitle": "SAMUEL APPIAH AMPOFO v COMMISSION ON HUMAN RIGHTS AND ADMI",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana ruled on a reference from the High Court concerning the constitutionality of CHRAJ's investigative panel system. The plaintiff challenged the validity of an investigation conducted by a panel including a Senior Legal Officer and a Principal Investigator, arguing that only the Commissioner and two Deputy Commissioners could exercise CHRAJ's functions under Article 216 of the 1992 Constitution. The Court unanimously held that the term 'Commission' must be interpreted purposively and contextually, recognizing both a narrow sense (the three principal officers) and a wider sense (the entire institution with staff and branches). It found that Regulations 6 and 7 of CI 7, which authorize investigative panels composed of Commission officers, are constitutional. The Court emphasized that a literal interpretation would render CHRAJ ineffective, as three individuals could not practically investigate complaints or educate the public nationwide. It affirmed that specialized investigative skills are essential for CHRAJ's mandate and that the delegation of investigative functions to trained officers is consistent with the Constitution and Act 456.",
