  "caseTitle": "WELFORD QUARCOO V THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL, THE ELECTORAL RULING",
  "summary": "In Welford Quarcoo v. The Attorney-General & The Electoral Commission (J1/2/2012, 13th June 2012), the plaintiff sought an interlocutory injunction to halt actions under the Local Government Act, 1993 (Act 462) pending a constitutional challenge. The Supreme Court, per Dr. Date-Bah JSC, dismissed the application, holding that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate irreparable harm since declaratory relief in the main suit could nullify any adverse effects. The court emphasized that halting district creation would cause irreparable delay to government programs and the December general elections, which outweighed the plaintiff's interests. The balance of convenience and public interest weighed against granting the injunction.",
