  "summary": "This 1956 High Court of the Protectorate of the Gambia case involved a claim for recovery of possession of land formerly owned by Ousman N'Jie Modji, who died intestate. The plaintiffs included his widow and three daughters, while the first defendant was his ward, Samba N'Jie, who had occupied the land since 1941 under a tenancy-at-will. The court held that under native law and custom, the widow had no proprietary interest in the land, which passed to the children. The claim against the first defendant was time-barred under the Limitation Acts of 1833 and 1874 due to twelve years of uninterrupted possession. However, the claims succeeded against the other defendants—grantees of the first defendant—because their tenancies-at-will had not run the requisite twelve-year limitation period. The res judicata defence failed because prior native tribunal proceedings involved only the widow, not the daughters, who claimed independently.",
