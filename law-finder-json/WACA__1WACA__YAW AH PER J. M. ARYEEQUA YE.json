  "caseTitle": "YAW AH PER J. M. ARYEEQUA YE",
  "summary": "In this civil land dispute before the West African Court of Appeal, the plaintiff, Yaw Ah Per J. M. Aryeequa, successfully claimed ownership of a parcel of land in Accra against the defendant, J. E. Maslieno, who had acted as caretaker. The Ga Manche Tribunal had previously affirmed her title and directed that the defendant remain as caretaker. During the appeal process, a receiver was appointed to collect rents. After the Court of Appeal dismissed the defendant’s appeal and upheld the plaintiff’s ownership, the Provincial Commissioner ordered the receiver to pay the collected rents to the plaintiff. The defendant challenged this, claiming entitlement as caretaker. The Court rejected this, holding that under native custom, a caretaker is not entitled to rents but only to reasonable remuneration at the owner’s discretion. The order was upheld, and the appeal dismissed with costs.",
