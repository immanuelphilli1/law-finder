  "caseTitle": "TSATSU TSIKATA",
  "summary": "This is a criminal appeal before the Supreme Court of Ghana, heard on January 19, 2011, concerning whether the appeal had become moot following the delivery of judgment by the High Court and the pendency of the appellant's appeal. The case was originally scheduled for judgment on June 25, 2008, but its delivery was delayed due to a motion for arrest filed by the appellant. The bench, presided over by Justice Atuguba, considered procedural issues surrounding the continuation of the appeal, including prior judicial treatment of mootness in appellate matters. The truncated nature of the document limits access to the final determination.",
