  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC v. THE HIGH COURT, BOLGATANGA, HAJIA FATI SEIDU",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana, in an ex-parte application by Madam Hawa Yakubu, quashed the proceedings and order of the Bolgatanga High Court dated 6th January 2001 in an election petition filed by Hajia Fati Seidu. The petition sought a recount of votes and injunctions preventing Yakubu from taking her parliamentary seat following the December 2000 elections for Bawku Central Constituency. The Supreme Court held that the petition was prematurely filed before the official gazette publication of results on 5th January 2001, violating Section 18(1) of PNDCL 284, which mandates a 21-day window after gazette publication for non-corrupt practice petitions. Additionally, the Court found a breach of natural justice (audi alteram partem) as Yakubu was not heard despite being directly affected by the order for a physical vote recount involving her votes.",

    "The election petition was filed before the gazette publication of results, making it premature under Section 18(1) of PNDCL 284.",
