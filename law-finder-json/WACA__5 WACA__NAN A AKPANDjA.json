  "caseTitle": "NAN A AKPANDjA",
  "summary": "This Privy Council appeal from the West African Court of Appeal concerned a land ownership dispute between two chiefs—Nan a Akpandja, paramount chief of Buem Borada under British mandate, and Fiaga Egblomesse, chief of Akposso Badu under French mandate—over approximately 15 square miles of land in British Togoland. The dispute centered on historical claims of original ownership, conquest from the Kwawu people, and post-conquest possession. The Acting District Commissioner initially divided the land, awarding the northern portion to the appellant and the southern to the respondent, a decision upheld by the West African Court of Appeal. The appellant appealed to the Privy Council, challenging both the evidentiary basis and the discovery of a German map allegedly showing the boundary further east. The Privy Council dismissed the appeal, affirming that the trial officer’s findings—based on witness testimony, site inspection, and physical indicators like farm possession and a boundary stone heap—were valid. The German map was rejected due to insufficient proof of authoritative origin and unavailability for cross-examination. The Council clarified the boundary, substituting boundary post 78A for 78B, and affirmed ownership accordingly, with the appellant to pay costs.",
