  "caseTitle": "SAID AJAMI v THE COMPTROLLER OF CUSTOMS 2",
  "summary": "The Privy Council upheld a decision by the West African Court of Appeal affirming penalties against Said Ajami for attempting to export 9,884,500 French Colonial Francs from Nigeria in violation of the Exchange Control Ordinance, 1950. The key issue was whether the notes were legal tender in French West Africa, a territory covered under the Ordinance. The Comptroller of Customs relied on the testimony of Mr. Greenway, a Barclays Bank manager with 32 years of banking experience, who stated the notes were legal tender 'to the best of my knowledge'. The appellant challenged the competency of a non-lawyer to testify on foreign law and the sufficiency of the evidence. The Privy Council held that practical professional experience, especially for an authorised foreign currency dealer operating near French West Africa, qualified Mr. Greenway as a competent expert under sections 56 and 57 of the Nigerian Evidence Ordinance. His unchallenged testimony, combined with the bank's authorised status, was deemed sufficient to prove the notes were legal tender. The appeal was dismissed.",
