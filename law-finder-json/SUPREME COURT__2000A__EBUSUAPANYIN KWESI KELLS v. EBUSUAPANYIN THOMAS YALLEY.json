  "caseTitle": "EBUSUAPANYIN KWESI KELLS v. EBUSUAPANYIN THOMAS YALLEY",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed the appeal filed by Ebusuapanyin Thomas Yalley, affirming that House No. 27/2 Ahanta Road, Takoradi, is family property and not subject to private testamentary disposition. The property was originally leased to Ekua Nkontomponyi, mother of the deceased Amos Thomas Yalley, who took possession after her death and renewed the lease in his name. Although he demolished the original structure and built a new one using personal funds, the court held that he held the property as a constructive trustee for the family. The court reaffirmed the principle in Ansah v. Sackey that a family member who builds on family land retains only a life interest, which cannot be alienated without family consent. Since there was no valid gift or fulfillment of customary requirements, the late Amos Thomas Yalley lacked testamentary capacity to bequeath the property. The Supreme Court upheld the concurrent findings of the lower courts, finding no miscarriage of justice, and affirmed the declaration that the property belongs to the Ebiradze Family.",
