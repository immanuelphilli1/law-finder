  "caseTitle": "APPIAH v BAFFOUR (Aryee Ag J,",
  "summary": "This compilation from the 1989–1990 Review of Ghana Law reports several personal injury cases, primarily arising from road accidents resulting in fatalities. The courts awarded damages based on loss of dependency, loss of expectation of life, funeral expenses, pain and suffering, and special damages. Awards varied significantly depending on the deceased's income, number and age of dependants, and duration of survival post-accident. For instance, in APPIAH v BAFFOUR, a driver's death led to a GH4,680,000 award, including GH4,000,000 for loss of dependency. Even minors with income, such as a 17-year-old coalpot maker in KOOMSON v EDU, received compensation for loss of expectation of life. The judgments reflect structured assessment of economic and non-economic losses, with some courts factoring in tax implications and costs separately.",
