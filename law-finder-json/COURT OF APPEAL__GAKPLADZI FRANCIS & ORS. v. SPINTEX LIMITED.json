  "caseTitle": "GAKPLADZI FRANCIS & ORS. v. SPINTEX LIMITED",
  "summary": "In Gakpladzi Francis & Ors. v. Spintex Limited, former employees challenged their dismissal after protesting a company policy requiring them to 'work to cover' hours lost due to power cuts. The Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's ruling that the dismissal was unjustified. The 'work to cover' directive (Exhibit B) was a unilateral variation of the collective agreement, violating Section 10(4) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1965 (Act 299), and thus void. The subsequent suspension of the redundancy exercise and demand for resignations constituted an unfair ultimatum. The employees' peaceful demonstration was protected under Article 21(1)(d) of the 1992 Constitution. The company's claim of an illegal strike failed due to lack of credible evidence of violence or property damage. The court affirmed the employees' right to redundancy benefits and declared the dismissals unlawful.",
