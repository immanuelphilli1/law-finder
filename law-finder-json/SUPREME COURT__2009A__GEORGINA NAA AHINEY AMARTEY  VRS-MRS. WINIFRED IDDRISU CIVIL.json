  "summary": "This is a civil appeal before the Supreme Court of Ghana concerning the validity of a 'Further Defence to Reply and Counterclaim' filed by the defendant on December 18, 2000, in a land dispute. The plaintiff had initially filed suit claiming title to land at Tesano, Accra, but later discontinued the action. The defendant proceeded with a counterclaim based on the contested pleading. The trial court, per Kusi-Appouh J, upheld the pleading, citing implied court sanction and failure of prior counsel to object. The Court of Appeal reversed, holding the pleading was filed without leave and was procedurally invalid. The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeal, ruling that procedural compliance is mandatory; a pleading not authorized by the High Court Civil Procedure Rules cannot be validated by implied consent or failure to object. The Court emphasized that Superior Courts are courts of record, and the absence of a recorded ruling on November 9, 2000, negated claims of prior judicial approval. Thus, the counterclaim and its trial were deemed a nullity.",
