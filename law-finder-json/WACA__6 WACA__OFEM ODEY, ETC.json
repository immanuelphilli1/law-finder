  "caseTitle": "OFEM ODEY, ETC",
  "summary": "This appeal originated from a suit commenced in the Native Court of Olulumo, where the parties appeared in their individual capacities as shown in the original writ of summons. The case was transferred to the High Court of Enugu under section 25(1)(c) of the Native Courts Ordinance No. 44 of 1933. In the High Court, the heading of the suit was altered to reflect that the parties were acting in representative capacities, though no formal amendment to the writ was made. The plaintiff alleged representative capacity in the statement of claim, while the defendant initially denied it, citing the original writ. However, during trial, both counsel and the court proceeded on the assumption that the parties were in representative capacities, despite the absence of any amendment. The West Africa Court of Appeal held that, given the uncertainty over whether such an amendment could have been legally permitted under the Ordinance, and in light of the binding precedent in Malm v Wulf, the trial could not be validated by mere assumption. Consequently, the entire trial was declared a nullity, the judgment and costs order were set aside, and each party was ordered to bear their own costs.",
