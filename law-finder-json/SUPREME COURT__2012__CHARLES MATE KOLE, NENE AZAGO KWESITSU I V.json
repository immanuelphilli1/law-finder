  "caseTitle": "CHARLES MATE KOLE, NENE AZAGO KWESITSU I V",
  "summary": "The plaintiffs challenged the validity of Local Government Instrument (L.I.) 1983, which transferred several electoral areas from the Lower Manya Krobo District in the Eastern Region to the Dangme West District in the Greater Accra Region. They argued that this transfer violated Article 5 of the 1992 Constitution, which safeguards regional boundaries, and that both the Minister and Parliament acted beyond their powers under the Local Government Act and Article 11 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court found that Parliament improperly altered the original L.I. 1983 by changing the number of electoral areas without legal authority, violating Article 11. It emphasized that such instruments can only be approved or annulled, not amended. The Court also highlighted that determining territorial boundaries involves customary chieftaincy law, particularly regarding the Osudoku State, and cautioned against relying solely on maps. Ultimately, the Court declared L.I. 1983 unconstitutional to the extent it altered regional boundaries, affirming the supremacy of the Constitution and the limits of parliamentary and executive power in boundary delineation.",
