  "summary": "In Her vie v. Tamakloe and Others, heard in the High Court, Eastern Judicial Division, the plaintiff sued as head of the Avu family seeking an injunction and damages for trespass to family creeks. The defendants denied the plaintiff's membership in the male line and his headship. The court found that the plaintiff failed to prove descent in the male line and provided no evidence of formal or implied appointment as family head under native custom. Despite prior judicial recognition of male-line descendants as managers of the creeks, the plaintiff’s inconsistent testimony and lack of evidentiary support for his headship led to dismissal of the claim. The judgment emphasized that family headship in patrilineal societies is not automatic but requires appointment or acceptance by family elders, who may select candidates outside the direct male line if necessary.",

    "No evidence was presented that the plaintiff was elected or supported in acts of headship by principal family members.",
    "The role of Mankralo of Bator does not automatically equate to headship of the Avu family.",

  "confidenceNotes": "High confidence in factual accuracy based on detailed judicial reasoning, citation of precedent, and clear evidentiary analysis. Some peripheral details (e.g., exact date of Coussey J.'s judgment) appear inconsistently (1958 cited in text vs. 1948 in body), but core legal principles and outcome are clearly established.",
