  "caseTitle": "SAFURATU TAYLOR",
  "summary": "This appeal concerned a creditor's claim against the estate of David Augustus Taylor, where the plaintiff-appellant sought payment of a judgment debt of £450 and costs from moneys deposited in court from the estate's assets. The lower court refused the application, relying on the Administration of Estates Act 1925, s 34, which mandates pari passu distribution among creditors in insolvent estates. The West Africa Court of Appeal reversed, holding that the matter was not a 'probate cause or proceeding' under section 16 of the Supreme Court Ordinance (Cap. 3), as it involved a dispute over asset distribution rather than the grant of probate. Applying the test of whether such a matter would be heard in the English Probate or Chancery Division, the court concluded it belonged in the latter, meaning English law did not automatically apply. Thus, the pre-existing Nigerian practice allowing priority to earlier judgment creditors was upheld, and the appeal was allowed to grant the plaintiff’s motion for payment from court funds.",

  "rationaleHighlights": [
    "The key issue was whether the Administration of Estates Act 1925 applied via section 16 of the Supreme Court Ordinance.",
    "The court held that the matter was not a 'probate cause' because it involved distribution disputes, not grant of probate.",
    "The test applied was whether the matter would be heard in the Probate or Chancery Division in England.",
    "Since such matters are handled in the Chancery Division in England, section 16 does not apply.",
    "Therefore, English law (1925 Act) does not automatically apply, and Nigerian practice on creditor priority stands."
