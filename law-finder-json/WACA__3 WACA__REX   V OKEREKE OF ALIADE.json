  "caseTitle": "REX V OKEREKE OF ALIADE",
  "summary": "The West Africa Court of Appeal heard an appeal against sentences imposed on two appellants, Okereke and Obassi of Alia, who were convicted of possessing and attempting to utter counterfeit coins in the Northern Provinces. Both were originally sentenced to three years of hard labour (LH.L.) by the High Court of Kaduna Division. The appellate court found the sentences not excessive and, considering that the appellants originated from the Southern Provinces—a region where counterfeiting is widespread—deemed it necessary to enhance the sentences to deter the spread of such crimes into the Northern Provinces. The Crown had requested harsher penalties. The court quashed the original sentences and increased them to four years of hard labour for each appellant, to run from the date of conviction.",
