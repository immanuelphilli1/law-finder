  "summary": "In this civil appeal, RocksHell International Ltd. (respondent) sued Wahome Steel Ltd. (appellant) for conversion of plant and equipment allegedly destroyed by fire and removed from a quarry site at Lawlawvor. The High Court awarded damages based on the claim that the equipment belonged to the respondent and was unlawfully taken. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, setting aside the judgment. It held that the trial judge erred in finding ownership and conversion without credible evidence, particularly given inconsistencies in the plaintiff's evidence and lack of corroboration. The appellant had acted under a letter from the Shai Traditional Council authorizing removal of scrap metal. Furthermore, the earlier criminal conviction of the appellant's representative for dishonestly receiving stolen property was quashed due to factual and temporal inconsistencies in the charges. The Court found the civil judgment manifestly against the weight of evidence and reversed the award of damages and costs.",
