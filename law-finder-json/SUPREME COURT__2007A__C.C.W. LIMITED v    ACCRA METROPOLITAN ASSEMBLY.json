  "caseTitle": "C.C.W. LIMITED v ACCRA METROPOLITAN ASSEMBLY",
  "summary": "This is a civil appeal before the Supreme Court of Ghana concerning the termination of a waste management service agreement between C.C.W. Limited (Plaintiff) and the Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) (Defendant). The 1997 agreement, intended to last seven years, was terminated by AMA in 2001. The Plaintiff claimed breach of contract and sought payment for services rendered, interest, damages, and loss of profit. AMA defended on grounds that the contract was illegal due to non-compliance with statutory procurement procedures under the Local Government Act 1993 (Act 462), specifically Sections 39, 87, and 88, and its own Standing Orders, particularly Section 67(1), which required oversight by a District Tender Board. AMA also argued that the contract required prior parliamentary approval under the Loans Act 1970 (Act 335) because it depended on external financing. The High Court found the contract was not signed under duress but was invalid due to failure to comply with procurement laws. The Supreme Court upheld this, ruling the agreement unenforceable and dismissing the Plaintiff’s claims, while also rejecting AMA’s counterclaims for account reconciliation and payment for asset use. The decision emphasizes strict adherence to public procurement and financial regulations in public contracts.",
