  "caseTitle": "ENNIMAH VERSUS KANGAH.",
  "summary": "In Ennimah v. Kangah, the plaintiff, a lessor of land, brought an action in a Native Court 'C' against the defendant who claimed a right to tribute from the land and had sworn the 'Ehanu' oath to enforce it. The plaintiff sought damages and required the defendant to show cause for demanding tribute. While the Native Court 'C' declined jurisdiction over the damages claim, it adjudicated on the second claim regarding the oath. On appeal, the Supreme Court of the Gold Coast held that despite the procedural form involving an oath, the real issue was the defendant's claim to tribute based on alleged overlordship over the land—making it a land-related matter. Under the Native Courts (Colony) Ordinance, Native Court 'C' lacked jurisdiction over land cases. Therefore, the court declared the proceedings before the Native Court 'C' and all subsequent appellate proceedings null and void due to lack of jurisdiction.",
