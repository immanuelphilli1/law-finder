  "summary": "In Rex v Matthias Enema, the appellant, a public servant charged with stealing under section 190(5) of the Criminal Code, was convicted on two counts in the Magistrate's Court. On appeal to the West African Court of Appeal, it was held that a material witness, Mr. Milne (Assistant District Officer), was not called despite being named by the appellant. The Acting Solicitor-General acknowledged this procedural failure and did not oppose setting aside the conviction on count one. The court accordingly quashed the conviction and ordered an acquittal on count one. The appeal against conviction on count two was dismissed as without merit, as was the appeal against sentence.",
