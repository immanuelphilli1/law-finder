  "caseTitle": "APPLICATION TO ADDUCE FRESH EVIDENCE,",
  "summary": "In this civil motion before the Supreme Court of Ghana, the applicant sought leave to adduce fresh evidence—specifically, a map allegedly used in determining a boundary in a 1927 case—pursuant to Rule 76 of the Supreme Court Rules, 1996 (CI 16). The court held that the applicant failed to demonstrate the relevance of the map, as the binding authority remains the 1927 judgment, not evidence considered on appeal. Additionally, the applicant did not prove that the map was unavailable despite due diligence, nor did they produce the appellate record where the map was supposedly used. The respondent contested the map's role in the original proceedings. Ultimately, the court refused leave to adduce the evidence, finding it would not serve the interest of justice, and awarded costs of GHC 1,000 against the applicant.",
