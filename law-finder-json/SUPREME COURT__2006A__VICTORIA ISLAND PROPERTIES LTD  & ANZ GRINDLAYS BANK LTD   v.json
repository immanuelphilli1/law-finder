  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case, Victoria Island Properties Ltd & ANZ Grindlays Bank Ltd v Standard Chartered Bank Ghana Ltd & E.O. Effiong, concerns an appeal by Standard Chartered Bank (Appellant) against a Court of Appeal judgment holding it liable for the loss of US$82,000 fraudulently transferred from the Plaintiffs’ account. The fraud was executed by the second defendant, E.O. Effiong, who impersonated an officer and directed the transfer to a fictitious account. The Appellant bank paid out the funds despite the recipient having no foreign currency account. The Plaintiffs alleged negligence and conspiracy. The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' findings of negligence under Section 81 of the Bills of Exchange Act, 1961 (Act 55), rejecting the Appellant’s argument that liability should fall on the co-plaintiff bank. The Court emphasized banks' duty of care in international fund transfers and dismissed the conspiracy claim for lack of evidence.",
