  "caseTitle": "IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF JAMES TAYLOR, DECEASED",
  "summary": "In Rex v Yaw Tekyi (WACA/7, 11th June 1941), the appellant was convicted of murder after killing his wife upon discovering her in circumstances strongly suggesting recent adultery. He appealed, arguing that these circumstances constituted 'extreme provocation' under Section 234(3) of the Criminal Code, which includes 'an act of adultery committed in the view of the accused.' The West Africa Court of Appeal rejected this interpretation, holding that 'in the view of' must be given its natural meaning—requiring actual witnessing of the act—and not mere suspicion or circumstantial inference. The court emphasized that legislative intent would have been explicit if a broader interpretation was intended. Consequently, the conviction for murder was upheld and the appeal dismissed.",
