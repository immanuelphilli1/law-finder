  "caseTitle": "REX V ANYANWU NWANJOKU OF UMUHU",
  "summary": "The appellant, Anyanwu Nwanjoku of Umuhu, was convicted of murder for killing Arungwa Nwokoma, the head of their compound, after a fight with another man was interrupted. The deceased used a switch to separate the combatants, after which the appellant retrieved a matchet and fatally attacked him. The West Africa Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, ruling that the provocation was insufficient to reduce the crime to manslaughter under section 318 of the Criminal Code. The court held that the deceased's actions were lawful and reasonable as compound head, and the use of a deadly weapon in response to minimal force did not meet the threshold for mitigation. The appeal was dismissed based on established common law principles requiring proportionality and reasonableness in assessing provocation.",
