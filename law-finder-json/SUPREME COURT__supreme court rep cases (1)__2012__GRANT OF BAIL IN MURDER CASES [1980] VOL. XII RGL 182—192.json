  "summary": "This legal commentary analyzes the issue of bail in murder cases under Ghanaian law, focusing on the tension between section 96(7) of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1960 (Act 30), which mandates refusal of bail in murder cases, and constitutional provisions—first article 15(4) of the 1969 Constitution and later article 21(4)(a) of the 1979 Constitution—which guarantee release if an accused is not tried within a reasonable time. The article discusses key cases including Brefor v. The Republic, where Taylor J. revisited the issue, and contrasts it with earlier decisions in Dogbe, Prah, Seidu, and Donkor. It argues that the 1979 Constitution, as supreme law, renders section 96(7) of Act 30 subordinate when there is unreasonable pre-trial delay. The commentary endorses a broad interpretation of 'not tried within a reasonable time,' as seen in Gyakye and Owusu, where prolonged remand—such as three years—without trial constitutes a constitutional violation warranting bail, regardless of fault. It concludes that despite statutory restrictions, constitutional rights to timely trial entitle murder suspects to bail when trial delays are excessive.",
