  "caseTitle": "BUAKO STOOL VERSUS SUHENSO STOOL.",
  "summary": "The Buako Stool sought certiorari to quash a decision by the Sefwi Wiawso State Council, which had declared title over disputed land in favor of the Suhenso Stool. The court held that the State Council lacked jurisdiction because boundary disputes over stool lands are not 'matters of a constitutional nature' as defined by the State Councils (Colony and Southern Togoland) Ordinance, c. 8 of 1952, s. 5. The application was properly filed in the Land Court, as the dispute concerned land ownership under the Courts Ordinance, c. 4 of 1951, s. 24(1). Although the ex parte motion was technically defective for not clearly stating grounds, the accompanying affidavit fully detailed them, curing the defect. The court emphasized that technicalities should not unduly affect African litigants. The application for certiorari was granted.",
