  "summary": "This 1957 High Court decision in EWUDZI v. DADSON addressed a procedural error in a private prosecution under Ghana's Criminal Procedure Code. The District Magistrate in Cape Coast had dismissed a charge of falsifying court records without hearing the prosecutor's evidence, accepting a defense submission that the charge was improperly laid. The High Court held that under section 168 of the Code, a magistrate must hear the prosecution's evidence after a 'not guilty' plea in a summary trial. It further clarified that under section 172(1), magistrates may amend or substitute charges if defective, but cannot dismiss them pre-evidence. The appeal was allowed, and a trial de novo was ordered.",
