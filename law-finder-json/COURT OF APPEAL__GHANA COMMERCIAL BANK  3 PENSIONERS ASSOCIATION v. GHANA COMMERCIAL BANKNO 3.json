  "summary": "This is a ruling by the Ghana Court of Appeal in Civil Motion No. 84/2003, dated 3rd July 2003, concerning a motion to complete a judgment previously delivered on 11th July 2002. The plaintiff/appellant, Ghana Commercial Bank Pensioners Association, sought procedural completion of the judgment. The court, presided over by Farkye, J.A., with Ansa and Asare Korang, JJ.A., held that in the interest of justice, the motion should be presented to the original panel that delivered the judgment. As the original justices were no longer available, the motion was adjourned sine die. The ruling is procedural and does not address the merits of the underlying case.",
