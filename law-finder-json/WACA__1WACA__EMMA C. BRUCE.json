  "caseTitle": "EMMA C. BRUCE",
  "summary": "This 1931 West African Court of Appeal decision in Emma C. Bruce v. Tom Boevey Barrett concerned an appeal against a judgment entered in absentia following substituted service of court documents outside the jurisdiction. The plaintiff, Emma C. Bruce, obtained a writ of summons against the defendant, who was residing in London, England, and was granted leave to serve the writ out of jurisdiction. After unsuccessful attempts at personal service, the court authorized substituted service at the defendant's last known address in London and by posting at the Supreme Court House in Accra. The defendant moved to set aside the judgment on grounds of irregularity, but the motion was dismissed. On appeal, the court upheld the lower court's decision, finding no procedural irregularities and affirming the validity of substituted service under the applicable rules of court, particularly Order X Rule 9 and Order III Rule 5 of the Rules of the Supreme Court.",
