  "summary": "In Winifred Iddrissu v. Luckman Iddrissu (Court of Appeal, Accra, 2000), the appellant, Winifred Iddrissu, appealed a High Court ruling that granted joint Letters of Administration to multiple parties, including herself, Luckman Iddrissu, and a customary successor. The deceased, Sulemana Ibun Iddrissu, died intestate in 1994. The appellant claimed to be the sole surviving spouse, supported by a 1992 marriage registration certificate in which the deceased declared no other existing marriages. The Court of Appeal held that the certificate constituted conclusive evidence of her status as the sole spouse, rejecting claims of other surviving spouses due to lack of rebuttal or objection during the registration process. The Court also found error in excluding the appellant’s children and including a non-applicant customary successor. Applying Order 2 Rule 6 of LI 1515 and Rule 32(1) of the Court of Appeal Rules, the Court allowed the appeal and granted Letters of Administration jointly to Winifred Iddrissu (sole spouse), Amin Abdul Iddrissu (her son), Iddrissu Sulemana, and Luckman Iddrissu, limiting the number to four administrators as permitted by law.",
