  "summary": "The 1989 Durbar of Attorneys, organized by the PNDC Acting Attorney-General Mr. Tanoh, served as an annual forum for assessing the performance of the Attorney-General’s Department and addressing systemic challenges. Deputy Secretary for Justice Martin A. B. K. Amidu delivered a written address highlighting critical issues such as inadequate logistics, deteriorating library facilities, and insufficient office resources, particularly affecting regional offices. He emphasized the attorney's role in national economic recovery, advocating for law as a tool of social engineering aligned with government policy. Amidu criticized substandard legal work, including improper pleading practices, and called for a continuing legal education system and periodic performance assessments. He lamented the decline in mentorship of junior attorneys and urged a return to rigorous training traditions to restore professional excellence and public confidence.",
