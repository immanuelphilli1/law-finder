  "summary": "This 1938 West Africa Court of Appeal decision in Rex v. Sanni Ladipo involved an appeal against conviction for slave dealing under section 369(3) of the Criminal Code on three counts. The convictions were based solely on the testimony of accomplices, including the father who gave his three sons into servitude and the sons themselves, who were deemed accomplices as they willingly participated. The court held that the trial judge erred in convicting without corroboration of accomplice testimony, citing R. v. Norris. The convictions and sentences were quashed, and acquittals were entered.",
