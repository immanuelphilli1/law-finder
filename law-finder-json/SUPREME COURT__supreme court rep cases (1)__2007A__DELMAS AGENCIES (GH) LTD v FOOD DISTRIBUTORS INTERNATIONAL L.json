  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana allowed the appeal filed by Delmas Agencies (Gh) Ltd against Food Distributors International Ltd, overturning the lower courts' award of damages. The case arose from a claim for loss of 6,234 cartons of yams allegedly damaged by rain at Tema Port in 1993 while under the defendant's custody as shipping agents. The High Court had awarded $349,104 plus interest and costs, which the Court of Appeal reduced to $200,000 despite finding the plaintiff failed to prove the measure of damages. The Supreme Court held that the Court of Appeal erred in making any award after determining the evidence did not support it. It further ruled that the plaintiff's witness lacked credibility, as her claims of payment were contradicted by the receipts, and that damages for a domestic loss should not be awarded in foreign currency. The appeal was allowed, the judgment of the Court of Appeal set aside, and the plaintiff's claim dismissed.",
