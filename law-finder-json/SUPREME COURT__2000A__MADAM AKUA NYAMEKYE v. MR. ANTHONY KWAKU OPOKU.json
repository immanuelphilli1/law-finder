  "caseTitle": "MADAM AKUA NYAMEKYE v. MR. ANTHONY KWAKU OPOKU",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed an application by Madam Akua Nyamekye to review its prior 3-2 majority judgment dismissing her appeal regarding eligibility for the Krobo Stool. The applicant argued that the split decision and alleged miscarriage of justice warranted review under Rule 54 of the Supreme Court Rules (C.I. 16). The Court reaffirmed that review is not a second appeal and requires exceptional circumstances such as fundamental error or newly discovered evidence. The applicant merely rehashed arguments from the original appeal, including claims about dynastic rights and exclusivity under Akan customary law. The Court found no fundamental error, noting that evidence such as the installation of S.K. Mainoo (an Ekuona) and the acceptance of dwantoa from the respondent contradicted the claim of an exclusive dynasty. The application was dismissed for lacking merit.",
