  "summary": "This case involved an appeal from a decision of the Battor-Mepe Native Court, which recognized the plaintiffs' ancestors as principal landowners but awarded possession to the defendants over portions historically granted as farming land. The appeal was initially heard by Chalmers Smith J., who found the judgment unclear regarding land boundaries and referred the case back to the Native Court for clarification, adjourning the appeal. Subsequent judges, including Jackson J. and van Lare J., issued further directions, but the case ultimately came before Manyo Plange J., who ruled that the appeal could not be continued from prior proceedings due to judicial discontinuity and ordered it to be heard de novo. The West African Court of Appeal upheld this decision, holding that an appeal partially heard by one judge cannot be resumed by another, and that the de novo order did not invalidate prior procedural directions. The appeal was dismissed, affirming the principle of judicial continuity in appellate proceedings.",
