  "caseTitle": "LARDAN VERSUS ATTORNEY-GENERAL",
  "summary": "In Lardan v. Attorney-General and Others (No.2), the High Court of the Ashanti Judicial Division considered the validity and effect of the Deportation (Othman Larden and Amadu Baba) Act, 1957, which terminated pending legal proceedings challenging the deportation of two individuals. The court held that although the plaintiffs sought a declaration of Ghanaian citizenship, the primary purpose of the proceedings was to impugn the deportation orders, thus falling within the scope of section 4(2) of the Act, which automatically determined such proceedings. The court further ruled that the Act was not unconstitutional under section 31(2) of the Ghana (Constitution) Order in Council, 1957, as it did not impose racial discrimination, since the targeted individuals were not singled out on racial grounds. Additionally, the court affirmed that Parliament possessed plenary legislative power under section 31(1) to make laws for the 'peace, order and good government' of Ghana, which could not be judicially reviewed unless it violated an express constitutional restriction. The decision emphasized parliamentary sovereignty and limited judicial oversight in post-independence Ghana.",
