  "summary": "This 1957 Practice Note from the Ghanaian Court of Appeal addressed a procedural error in juvenile court proceedings where infants under seven were improperly 'charged' with being deserted by their parents. The court clarified that the correct procedure under s. 72(1)(a) of the Courts Ordinance, c. 4 of 1951, requires a police officer to bring the child before the juvenile court with a sworn information alleging desertion, and to present evidence to support the claim. The court emphasized that parents, if known, must be given notice of the hearing to ensure their right to attend and participate. The failure to notify the father until after a 'fit person' order and financial obligation were imposed was criticized as procedurally flawed. The Court of Appeal issued binding guidance to standardize proper procedure in child protection cases.",
