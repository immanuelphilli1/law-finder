  "caseTitle": "RICHARD ODUM BORTIER DANIEL QUAYE VS.THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION OF GHANA, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL",
  "summary": "The plaintiffs sought declarations and orders requiring the Electoral Commission of Ghana to demarcate constituency boundaries in accordance with the egalitarian principle of fair representation under Article 47(3) and (4) of the 1992 Constitution, emphasizing population equality. They challenged the EC's past practices, including assigning fixed weights to population and land size and ensuring each district has a constituency, as leading to malapportionment. The Supreme Court dismissed the case, holding that the proper legal avenue for challenging boundary demarcation is via the tribunal established under Article 48 of the Constitution, not the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction. The plaintiffs were advised to pursue their claims before the newly constituted demarcation tribunal.",
