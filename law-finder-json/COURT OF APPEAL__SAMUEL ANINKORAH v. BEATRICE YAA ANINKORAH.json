  "caseTitle": "SAMUEL ANINKORAH v. BEATRICE YAA ANINKORAH",
  "summary": "This is an appeal from a High Court decision dissolving the marriage between Samuel Aninkorah and Beatrice Yaa Aninkorah, and determining ancillary reliefs. The parties married customarily in 1969 and converted to a monogamous marriage in 1982. The husband, a Ghana Army staff working with the UN in Israel, was found to have validly married another woman in 1996, which the High Court later declared null. The wife sought divorce on grounds of adultery, desertion, and cruelty, and claimed settlement of the matrimonial home in Kwashieman and a lump sum. The High Court granted the divorce, dismissed the cross-petition, but ordered the husband to convey a house in Tema to the wife and pay her GHS 40 million. On appeal, the Court of Appeal upheld the decision, holding that the wife failed to prove her contribution to the acquisition of the Kwashieman property, and that the trial judge properly exercised judicial discretion under Section 20(1) of the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1971 (Act 367). The appellate court found no error in the trial judge’s evaluation of evidence or application of law.",
