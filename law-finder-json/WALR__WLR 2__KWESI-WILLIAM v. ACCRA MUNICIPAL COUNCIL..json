  "caseTitle": "KWESI-WILLIAM v. ACCRA MUNICIPAL COUNCIL.",
  "summary": "Kwesi-William, employed by Accra Municipal Council as a market toll collector, was dismissed following a deficiency of £10 14s. 0d. discovered during a surprise audit on November 7, 1953. He claimed the loss resulted from a scuffle on November 4, during which 107 market tickets were stolen, and asserted he verbally reported the incident to superiors and later submitted a written report. The Council’s investigation committee found his explanation unsatisfactory, particularly given a prior similar deficiency and the delayed submission of the written report. The plaintiff argued wrongful dismissal, asserting inadequate inquiry and failure to follow civil service disciplinary procedures. The court held that in the absence of specific municipal employment regulations, the common law of master and servant applied. It found the Council had good cause for dismissal due to conduct inconsistent with faithful service, and no obligation to apply civil service General Orders or act judicially in the administrative sense. The claim was dismissed with costs.",
