  "caseTitle": "NAZIRE ABED v CHARLES LABA",
  "summary": "In NAZIRE ABED v CHARLES LABA, the Ghanaian Court of Appeal upheld a High Court judgment awarding damages to the plaintiff who was assaulted at a nightclub. The plaintiff, using crutches due to a recent knee surgery, was attacked by the defendant without provocation. The trial judge found that the defendant initiated a physical confrontation by slapping and assaulting the plaintiff, which constituted battery. The appellate court affirmed that the findings were supported by credible, uncontradicted evidence and that the award of general and aggravated damages was justified, particularly under the 'you take your victim as you find him' principle. The court rejected the argument for nominal damages, citing foreseeability of harm and the aggravating circumstances of the assault. The appeal was dismissed with costs awarded to the respondent.",
