  "caseTitle": "VICTORIA ISLAND PROPERTIES LTD & ANZ GRINDLAYS BANK LTD v",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case arose from a civil appeal by Standard Chartered Bank GH Ltd (Appellant) against a Court of Appeal decision holding it liable for the loss of US$82,000 fraudulently transferred from Victoria Island Properties Ltd (Respondent). The funds were transferred via telefax instructions by a third party, E.O. Effiong, who impersonated an authorized signatory of the Respondent and directed ANZ Grindlays Bank (Co-Plaintiff) to send the money to a fictitious account at the Appellant’s Liberia Road Branch. The Appellant paid out the funds to Effiong, who lacked a foreign currency account. The Respondent sued for conversion, negligence, and conspiracy. The High Court and Court of Appeal held the Appellant liable under section 81 of the Bills of Exchange Act 1961, interpreting it as imposing a broad statutory duty of care on banks. However, the Supreme Court reversed this, ruling that section 81 applies only to cheques and negotiable instruments, not electronic fund transfers. The Court found no negligence on the part of the Appellant, which acted in good faith and in accordance with payment instructions. The conspiracy claim was struck out for lack of evidence. The appeal was allowed, and the judgment against the Appellant was set aside.",
