  "caseTitle": "AMOABENG VERSUS MILLS",
  "summary": "In Amoabeng v. Mills, a police constable (plaintiff) was struck by a taxi (defendant) while crossing the road in Accra. The plaintiff claimed damages for negligence, but the defendant raised contributory negligence as a defense. The court found that the plaintiff had stepped into the roadway without due care, taking two or three steps into traffic without looking, despite the taxi approaching at high speed. Although the defendant may have been driving fast, the court held that the plaintiff’s failure to exercise reasonable caution was the decisive cause of the accident. Relying on Radley v. London and North Western Railway Company, the court concluded that the plaintiff's contributory negligence barred recovery, especially in the absence of the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act, 1945, which would have allowed apportionment of damages. Judgment was entered for the defendant with costs.",
