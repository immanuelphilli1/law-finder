  "summary": "In this 1939 West African Court of Appeal case, Akpan Udo Udo Essien appealed his murder conviction for the killing of Udo Udo Umoren. The appellant was identified as the person who sold the victim's bicycle shortly after the attack. Although the trial judge incorrectly characterized the appellant's post-arrest statement as a 'complete confession,' the appellate court found overwhelming evidence of guilt, including the appellant's own statement implicating himself in the crime, blood-stained clothing, and a dying declaration identifying the assailants. The court concluded that the mischaracterization did not affect the verdict, as the evidence was conclusive, and dismissed the appeal.",
