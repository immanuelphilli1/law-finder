  "summary": "The appellants were initially committed for trial by a Magistrate under the Criminal Procedure Code after a preliminary investigation. The Attorney-General, finding insufficient evidence, returned the depositions under section 202, prompting the Magistrate to reopen the case. At the reopened hearing, the prosecution withdrew charges and the appellants were discharged. Subsequently, the Attorney-General filed an information based on the same depositions, leading to arraignment and conviction at the Assize Court. On appeal, the Crown conceded the trial was a nullity for lack of jurisdiction. The Court of Appeal held that section 11(5) of the Court of Appeal Ordinance, which allows ordering a retrial by a competent court, only applies where proceedings were validly commenced but flawed. Since no valid proceedings existed after the discharge, the conviction was quashed and the appeal allowed.",
