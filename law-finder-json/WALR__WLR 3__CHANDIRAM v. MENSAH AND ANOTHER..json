  "summary": "In this 1958 Court of Appeal decision, the court considered the nature of the estate acquired by D. T. Chandiram when he purchased land from Holomah at a sale under a writ of fi. fa. Holomah had earlier created an equitable mortgage in favor of Barclays Bank by depositing title deeds. Before attachment on September 25, 1954, the deeds were sent to the Bank of the Gold Coast (later Ghana Commercial Bank) to hold on behalf of Barclays Bank. After attachment, the Bank paid off Holomah’s debt to Barclays and received a purported legal mortgage from Holomah on October 27, 1954. The Court held that this mortgage was null and void under Order 43, rule 7, as it was an alienation during attachment without court leave. Thus, the legal estate remained in Holomah, and Chandiram, as purchaser, acquired the full legal estate. The court rejected the appellants’ claim that Chandiram only acquired an equity of redemption, affirming the trial court’s declaration of title, award of damages, mesne profits, and possession to Chandiram. The decision was later reversed by the Privy Council in 1960.",
