  "caseTitle": "AND OTHERS VERSUS N'JIE AND ANOTHER.",
  "summary": "In this 1956 Gambian probate case, the plaintiffs sought revocation of letters of administration granted to the first defendant over the estate of Machimban N'Jie, who died in 1910. A will dated 1903, discovered only after the death of the last surviving beneficiary (Fatou N'Jie) in 1953, bequeathed property to Soseh, Fatou, and N'Dumbay as joint tenants. The defendant challenged the will's validity due to its late production and lack of probate. Miles J held that the presumption 'omnia praesumuntur rite esse acta' applied because any suspicion arose post-execution and post-death, with no evidence aliunde to rebut the will's validity. The court relied on Davis v. Mayhew and In re Goods of Francis Peverett, affirming that proper custody and internal validity suffice. It also noted that a Mohammedan may validly use an English-form will, governed by English succession rules. The letters of administration were revoked in favor of the will.",
