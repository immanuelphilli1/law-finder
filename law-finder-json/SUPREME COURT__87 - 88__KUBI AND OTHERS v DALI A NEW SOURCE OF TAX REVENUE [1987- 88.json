  "caseTitle": "KUBI AND OTHERS v DALI",
  "summary": "In Kubi v Dali, a trader injured in a vehicular accident was awarded damages for special damages, loss of goods, loss of actual and future earnings, permanent incapacity, pain and suffering, and loss of amenities. The Court of Appeal upheld the trial court's findings but identified an error in not deducting income tax from the awards for loss of actual earnings (GHC 13,000) and future earnings (GHC 180,000). Following the principle established in British Transport Commission v Gourley, the court held that damages should reflect net, not gross, income, as the plaintiff would have been liable to pay tax had she continued earning. Since precise tax assessment was impracticable, the court estimated the tax at one-third of the total earnings-related damages and ordered GHC 64,333 to be paid to the Commissioner of Income Tax. This decision marked a significant shift in Ghanaian jurisprudence by formally recognizing tax liability as a factor in assessing compensatory damages.",
