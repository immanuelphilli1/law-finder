  "caseTitle": "A THE PRIVY COUNCl 16TH OCTOBER 1936.",
  "summary": "This Privy Council appeal from the West African Court of Appeal concerned a civil action by the United African Company against its former agent for negligence and breach of contract, specifically under a 1933 agreement making him liable for deficiencies due to his act, neglect, or default. The trial judge improperly allowed witnesses (Acquah and Carr), who were convicted of falsifying books, to allege the defendant had committed fraud or felony by taking the missing £7,816—despite no such claims being pleaded. The judge then nonsuited the plaintiffs, citing the rule in Smith v. Selwyn requiring prosecution or excuse for non-prosecution before basing civil claims on felony. The Privy Council held this was erroneous: the claim was properly one in negligence, no fraud was pleaded, and thus the felony rule did not apply. They found the plaintiffs had reasonable excuse for non-prosecution, as police and law officers declined charges due to insufficient evidence. The Council emphasized the defendant must be treated as innocent and the case decided on the pleaded civil grounds. Though liability for negligence was evident, the matter was adjourned to determine the proper quantum of damages, as the prior proceedings had not fairly addressed this issue.",
