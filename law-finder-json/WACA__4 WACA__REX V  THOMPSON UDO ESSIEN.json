  "summary": "In Rex v Thompson Udo Essien (WACA/4, 10th August 1938), the West Africa Court of Appeal allowed an appeal against a murder conviction by the High Court of Calabar-Aba Division. The appellant was convicted of murdering Akpan Akpan Udo Iko and sentenced to death, but the appellate court quashed the conviction and entered a verdict of acquittal. The court found that the prosecution failed to call three key witnesses—survivors of the alleged attack on the appellant—who were essential to evaluating the appellant's claim of self-defense. The Crown had a duty to call these material witnesses, especially since the appellant had named them and taken police to their mother's house. The evidence presented was deemed insufficient to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. A 300-yard trail of blood from the appellant's house to the deceased's house supported the appellant's account that he was attacked first and wounded the deceased while defending himself. The trial judge's rejection of this possibility based on unsupported conjecture was criticized, particularly without medical evidence to assess the deceased's capacity to move after injury. The court also noted that all prosecution witnesses were family members of the deceased, whose testimony should have been treated with caution. Given that the appellant's version was consistent and plausible, and aligned with the justification under section 286 of the Criminal Code (self-defense), the court held that he should have been acquitted.",
