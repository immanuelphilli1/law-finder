  "caseTitle": "OSU STOOL v UNILEVER (GH) LIMITED",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed the appeal by the Osu Stool, which challenged the Court of Appeal's decision allowing Nii Nortey Owuo III, the Osu Mantse, to be substituted as the proper representative of the Osu Stool in a land-related civil suit against Unilever (Gh) Limited. The core issue was whether the matter involved a chieftaincy dispute, which would have deprived the High Court of jurisdiction. The Supreme Court held that no genuine chieftaincy issue arose, as the Osu Mantse presented prima facie evidence of his status via an extract from the National Register of Chiefs (exhibit NNOI), which is statutorily recognized under Section 50(8) of the Chieftaincy Act, 1970 (Act 370). The appellant's attempt to rebut this with a PNDC-era letter withdrawing government recognition (exhibit JKI) failed, as such withdrawal affects only statutory functions, not customary status, and the letter lacked the legal formality of an official legislative act. The Court emphasized that the issue was one of statutory and legal interpretation, not indigenous custom, and thus within the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts. It reaffirmed that the occupant of a stool is the proper person to represent it in litigation, citing Akwei v. Awuletey (1960).",
