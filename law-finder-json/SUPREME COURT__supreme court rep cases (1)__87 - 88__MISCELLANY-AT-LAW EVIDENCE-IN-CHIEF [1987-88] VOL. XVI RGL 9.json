  "summary": "This legal commentary discusses the conduct and challenges of examination-in-chief in Ghanaian court proceedings, emphasizing the importance of clear, chronological storytelling by witnesses under counsel's controlled guidance. It critiques common pitfalls such as leading questions, counsel dominating testimony, and judicial overreach during evidence presentation. The paper highlights that while relevant evidence should be admitted per Section 51 of the Evidence Decree, 1975 (NRCD 323), judges must avoid premature skepticism or dismissal of testimony as 'untrue' during examination-in-chief. It advocates for judicial restraint, proper witness management, and a focus on fairness over adversarial performance, citing comparative insights from common law jurisdictions.",
