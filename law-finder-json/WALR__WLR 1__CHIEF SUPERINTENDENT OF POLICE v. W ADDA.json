  "caseTitle": "CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE VERSUS W ADDA",
  "summary": "The appellant, Francis Omar Wadda, was convicted by a magistrate of theft by a clerk or servant for allegedly stealing 27 bags of groundnuts from his employer, the Gambia Oilseeds Marketing Board. His defence was an alibi, supported by two prosecution witnesses—Edward Mendy and Badou N'Yassi—who testified that he was on a work trek with them on January 18, 1956, the alleged date of the theft. However, the magistrate’s trial notes, the sole record, failed to include this crucial evidence. On appeal, both prosecution and defence counsel agreed the record was incomplete. The High Court held that appellate courts may depart from the trial record in exceptional circumstances, particularly when material evidence is omitted. Citing English authorities, it accepted counsel's statements about the trial proceedings. The court found the conviction unsafe due to the failure to consider the alibi evidence and the lack of clarity on dates and times, which must benefit the accused. The appeal was allowed, the conviction quashed, and the sentence set aside.",
