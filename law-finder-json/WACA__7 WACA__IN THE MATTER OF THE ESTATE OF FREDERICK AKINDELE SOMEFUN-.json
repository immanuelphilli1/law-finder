  "caseTitle": "IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF FREDERICK AKINDELE SOMEFUN-Deceased",
  "summary": "This West Africa Court of Appeal decision from 1941 concerns the distribution of the estate of Frederick Adetindele Somefun, who died intestate and was survived by issue from a statutory marriage under the Marriage Ordinance and a widow and children from a customary marriage. The central issue was whether the estate should pass to the statutory issue or to the customary family. The Court held that under section 36 of the Marriage Ordinance, the personal property of an intestate who is the issue of a statutory marriage must be distributed according to the English law of intestacy, which recognizes only monogamous unions, to the exclusion of native law or custom. Consequently, the widow and children from the customary marriage were excluded from succession. The trial judge was affirmed in revoking the grant to the Administrator-General and issuing a new grant to the statutory issue.",
