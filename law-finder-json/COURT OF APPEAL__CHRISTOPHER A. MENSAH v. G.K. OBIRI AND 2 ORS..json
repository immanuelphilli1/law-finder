  "summary": "This Court of Appeal judgment in Christopher A. Mensah v. G.K. Obiri and 2 Others (C.A. No. 1998, 4th May 2000) concerned whether the respondent, Christopher A. Mensah, was entitled to 10% shares allotted under a special resolution dated 3rd August 1986 by the third defendant company. The trial court had ruled in favor of Mensah, ordering the issuance of a share certificate. The appellants challenged the decision on grounds including alleged reliance on estoppel, error in burden of proof, and non-compliance with statutory timelines. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, affirming that statutory filings (CAM1, CAM2, CAM3) under the Companies Code, Act 179—specifically registration of the special resolution, alteration in shareholding, and increase in stated capital—collectively completed the allotment process and conferred membership status on Mensah under Section 30(2). The court held that these acts created a binding contractual effect, and the entries in the register of members were prima facie evidence of payment and entitlement. The appeal was dismissed, and the trial court’s judgment was affirmed with a variation directing issuance of the share certificate within 30 days.",
