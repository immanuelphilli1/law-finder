  "caseTitle": "MISCELLANY-AT-LAW A TALK BY JUSTICE J N K TAYLOR, JUSTICE OF",
  "summary": "In this 1987–1988 address to the Ghana Bar Association, Supreme Court Justice J.N.K. Taylor explores the 'dilemmas of law and lawyers in contemporary Ghana,' highlighting tensions between traditional Anglo-Ghanaian legal principles and emerging socialist legality under revolutionary governance. He critiques the concept of 'kalabule' as legally unjustifiable in the absence of price controls, warns against the subordination of law to unarticulated party policy, and expresses concern over the parallel system of public tribunals undermining judicial independence. Justice Taylor calls for a reaffirmation of the rule of law, legal clarity, and professional unity within the legal community amid political flux.",
