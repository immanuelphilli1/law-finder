  "summary": "The West African Court of Appeal heard an appeal by Abdul Hassan Sard, who had been convicted of murder by the Supreme Court of Sierra Leone. The appellant raised eleven grounds of appeal, grouped into three main issues: lack of jurisdiction, misreception of evidence, and misdirection of the jury. The Court rejected the jurisdictional challenge, holding that the Circuit Court had valid jurisdiction to try the case despite the accused being a non-native charged with a capital offense against a native. Regarding misdirection, the Court found no fatal error in the trial judge's instructions to the jury, noting that while the summing-up was summary, it was adequate and did not improperly restrict the jury's consideration of manslaughter or self-defense. However, the Court found that material hearsay evidence—specifically, testimony about the appellant's alleged confession to a chief regarding his motive for killing—was improperly admitted. Although the trial judge instructed the jury to ignore this evidence, the Court determined its prejudicial effect warranted setting aside the murder conviction. Nevertheless, under section 5(2) of the West African Court of Appeal (Criminal Offences) Ordinance, the Court substituted a conviction for manslaughter and sentenced the appellant to seven years' imprisonment with hard labour.",
