  "caseTitle": "KWAKU VERSUS ADDO.",
  "summary": "In Kwaku v. Addo, the plaintiff sued for damages over defamatory statements made by the defendant at a public political rally in Nungua, alleging he was portrayed as a malicious land grabber. The case raised the issue of whether the claim was grounded in English defamation law or native customary law. Under English law, the words were not actionable per se, and no special damages were proven. Under native law, the plaintiff relied on Sarbah's Fanti Customary Law to argue that defamation is actionable without proof of special damage. However, the court held that no general native custom recognizing a civil claim for pecuniary compensation in defamation had been judicially noticed or specially pleaded as required by Supreme Court rules. The court observed obiter that under native custom, the primary remedy for defamation is public recantation, with compensation being secondary, discretionary, and minimal. The action was dismissed due to lack of a recognized cause of action under either legal framework.",
