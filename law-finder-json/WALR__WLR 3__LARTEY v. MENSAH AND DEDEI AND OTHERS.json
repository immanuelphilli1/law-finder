  "caseTitle": "LARTEY VERSUS MENSAH AND DEDEI AND",
  "summary": "In Lartey v. Mensah and Dedei and Others, the plaintiff sued as head of the late Taiko Adam's family to recover possession of family title deeds. His authority to sue was challenged, requiring him to prove valid appointment under native customary law. Evidence showed that the previous head resigned during a meeting convened to resolve family disputes, and the plaintiff was subsequently elected. However, not all principal elders entitled to participate in the appointment were notified. The High Court held that under customary law, the appointment of a family head must occur at a properly convened meeting with prior notice to all eligible elders. Where notice is not given for the specific purpose of appointment, and key members are absent, the appointment is invalid unless later ratified. The court found the plaintiff's appointment invalid due to lack of proper notice and non-participation of all family branches. The Magistrate’s decision upholding the appointment was set aside, and the Accra Municipal Court’s judgment for the defendants was restored on corrected grounds.",
