  "caseTitle": "REGINA VERSUS DWAMENA AND ADD-ASARE",
  "summary": "The Court of Appeal in Ghana upheld the convictions of Dwamena and Add-Asare for conspiracy to steal and stealing by a servant under section 288(1) of the Criminal Code, c. 9 of 1951. The second appellant, serving as an unpaid treasurer of a co-operative union, was held to fall within the definition of 'servant' despite receiving no salary. The court distinguished the case from Commissioner of Police v. Addae, clarifying that being a paid employee is not essential to constitute a master-servant relationship for the purposes of section 288(1). Relying on R. v. Foulkes, the court emphasized that the key test is whether the individual was de facto employed in a role akin to that of a clerk or servant. The appellants' appeal was dismissed, with the court affirming that the trial judge correctly directed the charge under section 288(1).",

  "rationaleHighlights": [
    "The term 'servant' in section 288(1) includes unpaid individuals if they perform duties akin to a clerk or servant.",
    "Payment of wages is not essential to establish a master-servant relationship for criminal liability.",
    "The accused treasurer was not a mere gratuitous bailee but was employed in a position of trust.",
    "Precedent from R. v. Foulkes supports liability for volunteers acting in a servant-like capacity.",
    "The trial judge did not misdirect himself in applying section 288(1) to an unpaid office holder.",
    "Even if the charge under section 288(1) failed, the court could substitute a conviction under section 287(1).",
    "The appellants betrayed their trust by misappropriating funds under their control.",
    "An obiter statement in Addae's case limiting liability to paid employees was rejected as too broad."
  ],
  "confidenceNotes": "High confidence in factual accuracy based on direct quotation from the judgment and clear legal reasoning. The distinction between gratuitous bailment and employment is well articulated, and reliance on binding precedent strengthens the analysis.",
