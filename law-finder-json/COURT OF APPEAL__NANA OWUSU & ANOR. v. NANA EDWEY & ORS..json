  "summary": "In Nana Owusu & Anor. v. Nana Edwey & Ors. (CA No. 156/2000, 20 June 2002), the Court of Appeal of Ghana overturned a High Court decision that had dismissed claims by the Gomoa Akyemfo stool to land allegedly trespassed upon by the Mumford stool. The appellants argued that a prior judgment by a Commissioner in the Fuelwood Forest Reserve acquisition proceedings had already established their ownership, invoking estoppel per rem judicatam. The Court held that the prior decision, though limited to the reserve area, operated as res judicata over the entire disputed land because the same evidence and title issues were litigated. The trial judge erred by re-litigating the merits and ignoring the estoppel plea, especially since the respondents failed to prove root of title in the prior proceeding. The Court emphasized that where a wider area's ownership is at issue, a judgment on a portion binds the parties on the whole, preventing piecemeal litigation.",
