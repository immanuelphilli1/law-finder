  "caseTitle": "MISCELLANY-AT-LAW SECOND CONFERENCE OF SUPERIOR COURT JUDGES",
  "summary": "The Second Conference of Superior Court Judges in Ghana, held in July 1988, focused on the theme of 'Proof in Law' as part of a continuing judicial education program. Chief Justice E.N.P. Sowah delivered the keynote address, highlighting the success of the previous year's conference, which produced a self-regulatory Code of Ethics for Judges. He emphasized that while the Code is not statutory, it establishes binding standards of conduct, and violations may constitute judicial misconduct. The Chief Justice also addressed systemic delays in court record production, noting ongoing efforts to mechanise recording systems to ensure judgments are available within 24 hours. He discussed the legal framework of proof under the Evidence Decree (NRCD 323), distinguishing between the burden of persuasion and the burden of producing evidence, and stressed that the burden of proof determines outcomes when doubt remains. Papers presented by legal experts and judges sparked debate on cross-examination, evidence-in-chief, and the distinction between objective evidence and subjective truth. The conference underscored the judiciary's commitment to integrity, efficiency, and professional development.",
