  "summary": "In Rex v Amida Gbadamosi (No. 2) (1940), the West Africa Court of Appeal considered an appeal against the conviction of six appellants, including police officers, for breaking and entering and stealing \u0002300 from Samuel Aluko\u0002s shop in Ogbomosho under Section 410 of the Criminal Code. The appellants were sentenced to seven years' imprisonment with hard labour. The prosecution alleged the accused, posing as police officers, used deception to gain entry, searched Aluko\u0002s premises, seized the money under false pretenses, and fled with it. The appellants challenged the conviction on grounds including misdirection by the trial judge, lack of fair trial, improper exclusion and admission of evidence, unreliable identification, and miscarriage of justice. The appellate court reviewed the evidence and rejected all grounds of appeal, affirming that the trial judge had adequately directed himself on the evidence, that no procedural irregularities affected the fairness of the trial, and that the conviction was supported by the weight of credible testimony. The court also reaffirmed the recognized judicial function in Nigeria of assisting unrepresented accused persons in presenting their defense. The appeal was dismissed.",
