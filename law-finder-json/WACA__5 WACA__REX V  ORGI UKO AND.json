  "caseTitle": "REX V ORGI UKO AND",
  "summary": "The appellants, Orgi Uko and Yesufu Ashogbon, were convicted in the High Court of Aba for conspiracy to bring a false accusation under section 125 of the Criminal Code and unlawful possession of counterfeit coins under section 150A. The West Africa Court of Appeal upheld the convictions. The facts revealed that the second appellant harbored ill will toward the complainant, James Robert Mensah, after a prior dispute, and with the first appellant, they conspired to plant a package containing 10 counterfeit 1/- pieces, anticipating Mensah would pick it up. They then falsely reported to police that Mensah possessed and had uttered counterfeit coins. The court found that the conspiracy to falsely accuse Mensah—whom they knew was innocent—fell squarely within section 125. Regarding possession, while only the first appellant had actual possession, the second was held to have constructive possession through their joint criminal enterprise, citing R. v. Rogers. The appeal was dismissed.",
