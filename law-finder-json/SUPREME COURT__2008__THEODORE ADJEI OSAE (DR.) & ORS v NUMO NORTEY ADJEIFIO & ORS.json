  "caseTitle": "THEODORE ADJEI OSAE (DR.) & ORS v NUMO NORTEY ADJEIFIO & ORS",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case, decided on 7th May 2008, involved a civil land dispute between Dr. Theodore Adjei Osae and others (appellants) and Numo Nortey Adjefio and others (respondents) over a declaration of title and perpetual injunction concerning land in Teshie. The trial court had ruled for the appellants, but the Court of Appeal reversed the decision. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal's judgment, dismissing the appeal. The core issue was the boundary of Teshie quarter lands apportioned in 1927–1928. The appellants failed to establish the boundaries with certainty, offering conflicting oral testimony and relying on a site plan improperly attached to pleadings, which lacked proper evidentiary value. Crucially, Exhibit 1D4—a document authored by the first appellant as Chairman of Teshie Town Council—stated that Teshie lands extended to the Akuapim Hills, contradicting his trial testimony. This prior inconsistent statement, admitted without objection, carried significant weight. The Court emphasized that to succeed in a land title action, plaintiffs must prove identity and limits of the land by positive evidence, which the appellants failed to do. The Court also affirmed that Otinshie, founded before 1927, formed part of Kle Musum quarter, with allodial title resting in the respondents, leaving the appellants with only possessory or usufructuary rights. The appeal was dismissed on all grounds.",
