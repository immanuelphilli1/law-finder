  "summary": "In Wassem Attieh v. Koglex (Gh) Ltd & Ano. & Peacock Paints Ltd, the Supreme Court of Ghana addressed an application by judgment-debtors to stay execution of a 2001 judgment, set aside the award of interest at the prevailing bank rate, and substitute it with a fixed 4% post-judgment interest. The plaintiff objected, arguing the application was procedurally invalid under Supreme Court Rules. The Court held that a cause remains pending post-judgment until full satisfaction, citing English and local precedents, and affirmed its jurisdiction under Rule 5 of the Supreme Court Rules, 1996 (C.I. 16), which permits procedural flexibility where no express rule applies. The Court rejected the argument that dismissal of a review application extinguishes the matter, emphasizing that unsatisfied judgments remain pending and subject to further judicial intervention.",
