  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision in AXEX Company Limited v. Kwame Opoku & Others (2012) concerns a civil appeal against a summary judgment entered by the High Court and upheld by the Court of Appeal. The respondent, AXEX Company Limited, initiated proceedings seeking recovery of funds allegedly siphoned by its 50% shareholder, the first appellant, who transferred over 20 billion cedis to accounts of the other defendant companies without board consent. The High Court granted partial summary judgment for US$1,475,330 after the appellants' counsel admitted liability in court. The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' decisions, ruling that the writ and statement of claim together disclosed a valid cause of action and that the trial court had jurisdiction to enter judgment based on unequivocal admissions made in affidavit and oral submissions. The Court emphasized that such admissions justify 'judgment on admissions' under Order 23 Rule 6 of CI 47, and found no basis to set aside the summary judgment or the writ.",
