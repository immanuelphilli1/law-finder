  "summary": "This 1957 West African Court of Appeal decision in GBADAGO v. TSILI concerns a land dispute in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), where the plaintiff successfully challenged a judgment allegedly altered by fraud and conspiracy. The Native Appeal Court had orally delivered a judgment in his favor, but days later, the Registrar convened a meeting at the President's house—attended by the losing defendant—where the written judgment was recorded with unauthorized additions benefiting the defendant. The plaintiff sued in the Native Court to set aside the fraudulent portion. The Native Court and Land Court both ruled for the plaintiff, finding fraud and conspiracy. On appeal, the defendant argued lack of jurisdiction, estoppel due to abandoned appeal, and challenged the evidence. The West African Court of Appeal upheld the lower courts, affirming that Native Courts have inherent jurisdiction to set aside judgments obtained by fraud, that estoppel did not apply, and that the evidence supported the finding of fraud.",
