  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC VRS NATIONAL HOUSE OF CHIEFS, KUMASI NII LARBI",
  "summary": "This 2011 Supreme Court of Ghana decision in Civil Appeal No. J4/37/2010 involved a chieftaincy dispute between rival claimants to the Ablekuma Mantse stool. The appellant, Nii Larbie Mensah IV, was enstooled in 2000 and his name entered into the National Register of Chiefs in 2006. Adjin Tettey, the respondent, claimed prior recognition by a 1997 Ga Traditional Council judgment and sought mandamus to remove the appellant's name. The High Court and Court of Appeal granted relief, which the appellant challenged. The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' decisions, emphasizing that the National House of Chiefs must act fairly and reasonably under Article 23 of the 1992 Constitution. It found that the insertion of the appellant’s name without inquiry into pending disputes violated administrative justice principles, and the absence of prior demand for relief was excused due to constitutional imperatives.",
