  "caseTitle": "EBUSUAPANIN KOFI ASIEDU v. EBUSUAPANIN KWEKU APPIAH,",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana upheld the plaintiff's paramount or allodial title to the land known as MPREBUA in Breman Asikuma, affirming that the defendant's land (ABINA) was part of the plaintiff's larger parcel. While the Court of Appeal had granted the defendant usufructuary rights over portions he occupied, the Supreme Court found this determination unsatisfactory due to lack of clear findings on specific occupied areas and duration. The court dismissed the appeal on title but remitted the case to the trial court for fresh evidence to properly delineate areas of occupation and determine valid usufructuary interests. The Supreme Court also declined to uphold estoppel based on a 1980 settlement document (Exhibit 'A'), emphasizing the need for probative evidence on recent possession. No damages or injunction were ultimately awarded.",
