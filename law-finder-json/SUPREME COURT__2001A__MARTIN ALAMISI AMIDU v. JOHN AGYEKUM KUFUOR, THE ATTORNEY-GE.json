  "summary": "In Martin Alamisi Amidu v. John Agyekum Kufuor & Others (CM No. 8/2001), the plaintiff challenged the President's appointment of three individuals to key roles in the Office of the President without consulting the Council of State, as allegedly required by the Presidential Office Act 1993 (Act 463). The plaintiff sought declarations that these appointments were unconstitutional and requested injunctive relief. The Supreme Court dismissed the suit, holding that it lacked jurisdiction because the dispute concerned a statutory framework (Act 463), not a constitutional provision, and thus could not be adjudicated under the Court’s exclusive original jurisdiction under Article 130. The Court further ruled that no cause of action arose under Article 2(1)(b) of the Constitution, as the defendants’ conduct did not directly contravene a constitutional clause. Additionally, the case was deemed moot since the individuals had since been validly appointed as Ministers of State, making the relief sought academic. The Court also noted the improper joinder of the Attorney-General, whose office was vacant at the time of filing.",
