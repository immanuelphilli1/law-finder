  "summary": "This 1957 Supreme Court of Ghana decision addressed the unlawful use of a customary oath to obstruct judicial enforcement of land rights. The plaintiff had obtained a favorable judgment in both the Native Court and Land Court, granting him title to two parcels of land. Despite a pending appeal before the West African Court of Appeal, the plaintiff was entitled to immediate possession, as an appeal does not automatically stay execution. The defendant, a town linguist, swore an oath ('Amonoo Kwesida') to prevent the plaintiff from taking possession, prompting new proceedings in a Native Court. The Supreme Court held that this use of the oath was unlawful, as it circumvented existing judgments and violated the principle that res judicata applies between the parties. The court set aside the Native Court's ruling and awarded the plaintiff ₤75 in damages for wrongful interference with his possession, emphasizing the need to uphold judicial authority and protect established rights under native law and custom.",
