  "caseTitle": "MRS. JONAS ARYAN PAINTSIL v. SULEMANA & ORS.",
  "summary": "This appeal arose from the Circuit Court's refusal to set aside a default judgment entered against the 1st defendant (appellant) in a land dispute. The plaintiffs obtained default judgment in 1999 after claiming service via substituted means—posting court processes on the appellant's structure and delivering them to a neighbor, Mr. Yartey. However, no affidavit confirmed actual delivery to Mr. Yartey or receipt by the appellant. The appellant, claiming total ignorance of the suit, entered appearance in January 2001 after discovering his building had been demolished pursuant to execution of the judgment. He applied to set aside the default judgment, but the trial court summarily refused without giving reasons. The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge failed to exercise judicial discretion properly by not providing reasoned grounds for refusal, especially given uncertainties around service validity. While noting the appellant's delay and the plaintiffs' execution actions (including demolition and land transfer), the court emphasized that judicial discretion under Order 13 Rule 11 must be exercised justly, considering fairness, potential defence, and procedural irregularities. The appeal succeeded in part, with the matter remitted for proper consideration of whether the judgment should be set aside.",
