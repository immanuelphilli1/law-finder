  "caseTitle": "NEW PATRIOTIC PARTY v. NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS AND OTHE",
  "summary": "The New Patriotic Party filed a constitutional action seeking to prevent the National Democratic Congress from nominating two civil servants as parliamentary candidates, arguing that their nomination violated Article 94(3)(b) of the 1992 Constitution, which disqualifies civil servants from being members of Parliament. The Supreme Court dismissed the case as premature, holding that a mere intention to nominate does not constitute an actionable 'act' under Article 2(1)(b) of the Constitution. The Court emphasized that jurisdiction to challenge the eligibility of parliamentary candidates lies with the High Court through an election petition under Article 99(1)(a) and Section 16 of PNDCL 284, not via pre-election enforcement actions in the Supreme Court. The ruling reaffirmed that specific constitutional remedies must be followed, and the Supreme Court's general enforcement jurisdiction cannot override procedurally prescribed forums.",
