  "caseTitle": "ASHONG-METTLE VERSUS ASHONG-METTLE",
  "summary": "In Ashong-Mettle v. Ashong-Mettle, the petitioner sought a divorce on the grounds of the respondent's adultery with Matilda Agriba Hagan. The respondent admitted the adultery but claimed it was condoned through customary arbitration on May 17, 1955, which included conditions that he end the relationship, repay borrowed money, and cover the petitioner's medical expenses. The court found that the respondent failed to fulfill these conditions, particularly by continuing his association with the co-respondent, as evidenced by a photograph taken months after the arbitration. The judge held that condonation was conditional and not achieved due to non-compliance. Furthermore, even if condonation had occurred, the respondent's ongoing conduct constituted hardship and neglect sufficient to revive the grounds for divorce under the precedent of Richardson v. Richardson. The petitioner was deemed a credible witness, while the respondent was found evasive and untruthful. Consequently, a decree nisi was granted in favor of the petitioner.",
