  "summary": "The consolidated case of Nchonah v Appiah; Mensah v General Development Company Ltd (GDC Ltd); Hammond and Another v GDC Ltd, heard by Adjabeng J at Sekondi on 26 May 1989, involved multiple personal injury and property damage claims arising from motor vehicle accidents. The first plaintiff, a commercial farmer, sustained severe leg injuries resulting in permanent mobility impairment, leading to an award of �680,200, including �400,000 for loss of earnings. The second plaintiff in another limb of the case, a 32-year-old employee earning �2,400 monthly and survived by seven dependants, received �453,200 for loss of dependency and expectation of life. Other cases in the compilation addressed various injuries including fractures, amputations, disfigurement, and loss of livelihood across different regions of Ghana, with awards factoring in pain and suffering, loss of amenities, medical costs, and future earnings. The decisions reflect judicial discretion in assessing damages, particularly in absence of precise financial proof, and emphasize compensation for both economic and non-economic losses.",
