  "caseTitle": "REX v JOHNSON OGUMA",
  "summary": "This 1938 West African Court of Appeal decision involved Johnson Oguma, who was convicted under sections 404(1) and 100 of the Criminal Code for demanding property as a public officer and receiving property to show favor. The appeal challenged the convictions. The court found that while the second count was validly sustained, the third count failed because section 100 requires a transaction pending with a person employed in public service, but the case involved a private prosecutor instead. Consequently, the appeal was allowed on the third count, leading to acquittal on that charge, while the appeal on the second count was dismissed, and the twelve-month sentence was upheld.",
