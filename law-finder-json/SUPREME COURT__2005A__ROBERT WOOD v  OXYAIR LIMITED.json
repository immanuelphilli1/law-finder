  "caseTitle": "ROBERT WOOD v OXYAIR LIMITED",
  "summary": "In this civil appeal before the Supreme Court of Ghana, the plaintiffs alleged a valid oral agreement with the defendants for a 40% share allocation in Oxyair Limited in exchange for services and financial contributions toward establishing an oxygen-manufacturing plant. The trial judge found in favor of the plaintiffs, concluding that the defendants breached the agreement. The Court of Appeal upheld this decision. On further appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts' rulings, holding that the trial judge's findings were supported by credible circumstantial evidence, including a receipt (Exhibit A) for a share deposit paid by one plaintiff. The defendants' counterclaim for damages and injunctions was dismissed due to lack of evidence and the relocation of the factory. The Supreme Court emphasized the principle that appellate courts should not disturb concurrent findings of fact unless a clear error is shown, and found no such error here.",
