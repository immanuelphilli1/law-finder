  "caseTitle": "REX v MATHEW OJO, JACOB",
  "summary": "This 1941 West Africa Court of Appeal decision in Rex v. Mathew Ojo and Jacob Jalugbo concerned an appeal against conviction for riot under section 71 of the Criminal Code. The appellants argued that the conviction was legally flawed because the trial judge acquitted the third accused, leaving insufficient averment that at least three persons participated in the riot—an essential element of the offence. The appellate court dismissed the appeal, holding that under section 30 of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance and Rules 4(3), (4), and (5) of the Criminal Procedure Rules, it was not necessary to explicitly allege the number of participants in the charge. The reference to section 71 of the Criminal Code in the information was sufficient to incorporate all essential elements of the offence by implication. The court found ample evidence that the appellants took part in a riot and ruled that the acquittal of a co-accused did not invalidate the convictions. The decision affirms the principle that statutory references in charges can satisfy formal averment requirements.",
