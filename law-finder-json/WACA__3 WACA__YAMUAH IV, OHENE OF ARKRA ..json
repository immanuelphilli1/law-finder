  "caseTitle": "Antu v. Ohene Kweku Buedu (F.C.",
  "summary": "This West Africa Court of Appeal decision from 1936 concerned a dispute over the estate of Joseph Duker Biney, alias Ohene Yamua Ansah, the late Ohene of Arkra. The plaintiff, Yamuah IV, claimed succession to the personal property of the deceased as head of the royal stool, seeking surrender of assets or ₤9,600 in the alternative. The deceased had amassed wealth through a private mercantile business in Saltpond, continuing this activity after enstoolment with the consent of his elders. He made a will disposing of his self-acquired property to his wives, children, and immediate family, which the appellant initially renounced probate of, leading to the respondent being granted letters of administration with the will annexed. The central issue was whether, under native customary law, all property of an Ohene automatically becomes stool property upon death unless explicitly earmarked as private. The court dismissed the appeal, holding that the deceased's property remained private due to clear separation, continuous personal management, and the custom of the Arkran people as testified by the Omanhene of Ekumfi. Relying on Sarbah’s principles and distinguishing Kofi Antu v. Ohene Kweku Buedu, the court affirmed that self-acquired property may be validly disposed of by will under customary law.",
