  "caseTitle": "REX v NASAMU",
  "summary": "The appellant, Nasamu, was convicted of the murder of his wife, Ode, by the High Court of Ibadan Division and sentenced to death. On appeal to the West Africa Court of Appeal, the sole issue was whether the proper verdict should have been 'guilty but insane' rather than 'guilty of murder.' The trial judge found ample evidence that Nasamu was insane immediately after the killing but concluded he failed to prove insanity before the act, hence returning a 'guilty' verdict. However, in a Rule 47 report, the judge noted Nasamu was 'definitely abnormal' at the time of the crime and 'most probably did not know the nature of his act.' The appellate court held that under Section 28 of the Criminal Code (applicable in the jurisdiction), the burden of proof for insanity is lower than the prosecution's standard and akin to the civil standard. It ruled that a finding of 'most probable' lack of knowledge suffices to meet this burden. Furthermore, the court interpreted 'contemporaneous acts' to include conduct immediately after the offense, meaning post-killing insanity is relevant to the mental state during the act. Given the trial judge's strong observations, the appellate court substituted the verdict to 'guilty but insane,' emphasizing that the legal framework required a more liberal interpretation of mental state evidence.",
