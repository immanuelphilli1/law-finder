  "caseTitle": "GHANA COMMERCIAL BANK LTD. HIGH STREET, ACCRA v. THE COMMIS",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana upheld the enforcement of a CHRAJ decision that found the Ghana Commercial Bank's termination of a manager's employment to be discriminatory and a violation of fundamental human rights under Article 17 of the 1992 Constitution. The manager was dismissed for granting a loan without authorization, while others who approved larger unauthorized loans faced no consequences. The Court held that such disparate treatment constituted discrimination, violating the constitutional right to equality. It affirmed that CHRAJ has jurisdiction over such complaints in private enterprises when fundamental rights are at issue, and that constitutional principles override common law contract doctrines. The Bank's appeal, which challenged the legality and enforceability of CHRAJ's decision, was dismissed.",
