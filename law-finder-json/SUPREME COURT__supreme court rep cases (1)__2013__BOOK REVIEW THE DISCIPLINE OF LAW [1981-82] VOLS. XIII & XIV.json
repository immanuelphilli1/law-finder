  "summary": "This document is a book review of Lord Denning's 'The Discipline of Law' (1979), originally published in the Review of Ghana Law 1981–82. The review highlights Denning's advocacy for legal reform to align 19th-century legal principles with 20th-century social realities. It outlines his judicial philosophy across seven key areas: construction of documents, misuse of ministerial powers, locus standi, abuse of group powers, the High Trees case and promissory estoppel, negligence, and the doctrine of precedent. Denning is portrayed as a progressive judge who favored purposive interpretation, expanded access to justice, and judicial activism within the Court of Appeal. The review also emphasizes his clear, engaging writing style, courtroom advocacy advice, and influence on modern English law, particularly in negligence and administrative law. Though not a Ghanaian case, it reflects legal principles relevant to common law jurisdictions.",
