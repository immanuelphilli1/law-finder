  "caseTitle": "MOHAMMED IBRAHIM KAMIL VRS",
  "summary": "The appellant, Mohammed Ibrahim Kamil, was convicted by the High Court and later sentenced to 15 years imprisonment by the Court of Appeal for possession of 588.33 kilograms of cocaine without lawful authority, contrary to section 2 of PNDCL 236. The Supreme Court upheld the conviction, finding that the prosecution proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had constructive possession of the drugs through his active role in transporting and concealing the drug-laden boxes at the accused's residence. Despite denying involvement, the appellant's actions—including driving the vehicle, hiring laborers, and personally carrying boxes—supported the lower courts' findings. The Court emphasized that concurrent factual findings by lower courts are not easily overturned absent a clear miscarriage of justice, which was not demonstrated here.",
