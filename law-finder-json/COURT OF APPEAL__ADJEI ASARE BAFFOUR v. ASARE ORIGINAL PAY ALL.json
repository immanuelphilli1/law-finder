  "caseTitle": "ASARE BAFFOUR v. ASARE ORIGINAL PAY ALL",
  "summary": "In this appeal from a Circuit Court judgment, the plaintiff (respondent below) claimed GHS 7.4 million from the defendant (appellant), a licensed District Weekly Lotto operator, for winnings from numbers drawn on October 21, 1995. The plaintiff argued that his agent (Pw1) paid the stake on his behalf before the draw, but the Court of Appeal found otherwise. The court held that the transaction was illegal under PNDCL 223 and Act 94 because the draw occurred on a Saturday, corresponding to the national lottery operated by the Department of National Lotteries, which the defendant was not authorized to conduct. Thus, the bet constituted a prohibited 'clandestine lotto.' Additionally, the court ruled that a stake must be paid before the draw to be valid, and payment the day after cannot retroactively validate a bet. The trial court's finding of pre-draw payment was deemed unreasonable. Consequently, the appeal was allowed, the lower court's judgment set aside, and the plaintiff's claim dismissed. Both parties were ordered to bear their own costs due to their involvement in an illegal transaction.",
