  "caseTitle": "SUMAILA BIELBIEL VRS. ADAMU DARAMANI, THE ATTORNEY GEN",
  "summary": "In this 2012 Supreme Court of Ghana ruling, the court addressed the procedural issue of which party should open oral testimony in a case concerning whether Adamu Daramani, a Member of Parliament, held British citizenship at the time of his election and swearing-in. The court distinguished between the 'burden of persuasion' and the 'burden of producing evidence' under the Evidence Act 1975 (NRCD 323), noting that while the burden of persuasion remained on the plaintiff, the evidential burden could shift to the defendant. The court initially considered allowing the first defendant to open due to the evidential burden on him regarding his citizenship status, but withdrew the offer after defense counsel objected. The court emphasized that the right to open is a privilege, not a compulsion, citing Lord Denman CJ in Mercer v Whall. Ultimately, the court unanimously invited the plaintiff to open his case, affirming that the defendant's refusal did not alter the legal burden of proof.",
