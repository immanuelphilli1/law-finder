  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case, KLIMATECHNIK ENGINEERING LTD v. SKANSKA JENSEN INTERNATIONAL (CIVIL APPEAL NO. 9/2000, 23rd July 2003), arose from a dispute over unpaid HVAC subcontract work at the Golden Tulip Hotel. The plaintiff, a Cypriot engineering firm, performed over 90% of the work based on initialled draft terms and meeting minutes (Exhibit G), but the formal subcontract (Exhibit H) was never executed. The defendant terminated the engagement for failure to provide a performance bond, a clause in the unexecuted draft. The High Court and Court of Appeal found the termination unlawful, as the binding agreement was limited to Exhibit G, which did not require a bond. The courts awarded the plaintiff USD 224,533.29 on a quantum meruit basis for services rendered. The Supreme Court upheld these decisions, rejecting the defendant's counterclaim as unsubstantiated and affirming the validity of a foreign currency award in a restitution claim. The appeal was dismissed, reinforcing that substantial performance entitles a party to reasonable compensation even without a final signed contract.",
