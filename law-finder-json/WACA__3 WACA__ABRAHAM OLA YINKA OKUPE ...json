  "caseTitle": "ABRAHAM OLA YINKA OKUPE ..",
  "summary": "This West Africa Court of Appeal decision from 1937 concerned a private application for an information in the nature of quo warranto filed by Abraham Ola Yinka Okupe against Soyebo, the Alaperu of Iperu, challenging his authority to hold the traditional chieftaincy position. The court dismissed the appeal, holding that quo warranto could not lie because the office of Alaperu of Iperu was neither created by nor held under the Crown. The Chief Justice emphasized that the position arose from native custom and was elective by local chiefs and elders, not established under colonial law or the Native Authority Ordinance of 1933. Citing Halsbury and Adanji v. Hunvoo, the court affirmed that such traditional roles constitute mere dignities or honors, not public offices subject to this legal remedy. The decision underscores the jurisdictional limits of common law remedies in relation to indigenous traditional institutions under colonial rule.",
