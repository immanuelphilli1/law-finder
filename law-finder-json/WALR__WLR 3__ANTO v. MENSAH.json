  "caseTitle": "ANTO v. MENSAH",
  "summary": "In Anto v. Mensah, a 1957 Court of Appeal decision in Ghana, the plaintiff sought damages for trespass and a declaration of title after the defendant cut down trees on disputed land. The defendant admitted the plaintiff's ownership of the main farm but claimed he was demarcating a boundary between adjacent farms, inadvertently destroying trees. The Native Court initially ruled for the plaintiff, relying partly on observations from a visit to the site (locus in quo), but the Land Court reversed this, citing insufficient proof of title and undue reliance on non-recorded site observations. The Court of Appeal reinstated the Native Court’s decision, holding that possession sufficed to maintain a trespass claim where title was not genuinely disputed, and that courts may reasonably weigh impressions from a locus visit when evaluating evidence, especially absent formal plans. It also affirmed that under native custom, boundary demarcation requires joint action by adjoining landowners.",
