  "caseTitle": "DUNCAN AND OTHERS VERSUS CAPE COAST MUNICIPAL COUNCIL",
  "summary": "In Duncan and Others v Cape Coast Municipal Council and Another, the Supreme Court of the Gold Coast held that a rate imposed by the Cape Coast Municipal Council for 1954–1955 was invalid due to non-compliance with statutory publicity requirements. Although the rate had been approved by the Minister and published in the Gazette, the Council failed to publish notice in at least one daily newspaper circulating in its area, as mandated by Regulation 2(2) of the Municipal Councils (Rates) Regulations, 1953 (L.N. 432). The court emphasized that under section 97 of the Municipal Councils Ordinance, a rate is invalid unless notice is given in the manner prescribed by valid regulations. While the Council also failed to give advance notice of its intention to levy the rate, the court held this omission did not invalidate the rate, as the Ordinance only made post-resolution publicity mandatory. The plaintiffs, as ratepayers, were granted a declaration of invalidity, but the claim for an account of collected rates was dismissed.",
