  "caseTitle": "YAA ASONKO v. KWAME POKU",
  "summary": "This appeal arose from a trespass action where Madam Yaa Asonko (respondent) claimed ownership and possession of a farm at Atwe-Nkwanta, allegedly granted by Nyinahin Stool in 1968. The appellant, Kwame Poku, a subject of Nkawie Stool, was found cultivating the same land and challenged the respondent’s title. The Court of Appeal overturned the Circuit Court’s judgment in favor of the respondent, holding that the land fell within Nkawie Stool land as determined by a prior boundary settlement and binding appellate decision (Civil Appeal No. 85/58). The court found that Nyinahin Stool lacked title to grant the land in 1968, rendering the respondent’s claim invalid. The appellant, having received a grant from Nkawie Stool in 1986 and being in effective possession by 1990, held a better title. The court emphasized that the respondent failed to discharge the burden of proving superior title in a trespass action and that the prior judgment (Exhibit A) did not constitute res judicata against the appellant. The appeal succeeded, the lower court’s judgment was set aside, and costs of ₵2.5 million were awarded to the appellant.",
