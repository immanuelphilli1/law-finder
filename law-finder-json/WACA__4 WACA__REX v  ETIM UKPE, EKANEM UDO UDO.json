  "caseTitle": "REX v ETIM UKPE, EKANEM UDO UDO",
  "summary": "The West Africa Court of Appeal heard an appeal by Etim Ukpe and Ekanem Udo Udo against their convictions for the murder of Akpan Udofia. The court quashed the conviction of the first appellant, Etim Ukpe, finding that his mere presence and agreement at a village meeting to kill an Okon man did not constitute aiding, counsel, or forming a common unlawful purpose under sections 7, 8, or 9 of the Criminal Code. The court held that such an agreement to act severally, not jointly, and mere intent without overt action does not make one an accessory before the fact. However, the second appellant, Ekanem Udo Udo, was found to have sufficient evidence linking him to the actual murder, including physical evidence and participation in the dismemberment and disposal of the body. His appeal was dismissed.",
