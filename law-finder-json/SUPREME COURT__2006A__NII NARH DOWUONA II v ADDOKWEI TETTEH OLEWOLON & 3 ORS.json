  "caseTitle": "NII NARH DOWUONA II v ADDOKWEI TETTEH OLEWOLON & 3 ORS",
  "summary": "This is a civil appeal before the Supreme Court of Ghana concerning a land dispute between the Boi Stool, represented by Nii Narh Dowuona II, and the defendants, Addokwei Tetteh Olewolon and others, who claim title through the Numo Nmashie family of Teshie. The plaintiff sought a declaration of title to 87.68 acres of land at Boi near Abokobi, perpetual injunction against trespass, and general damages. The trial High Court and Court of Appeal dismissed the claim, finding the plaintiff failed to prove title. The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' decisions, emphasizing fatal contradictions between the plaintiff’s testimony and that of his witnesses regarding the mode of ancestral acquisition of the land—vacant land versus conquest. The Court held that such internal inconsistencies undermined the plaintiff’s case, distinguishing this from rival traditional histories. The defendants relied on a prior Court of Appeal judgment (Civil Case No. 49/80) concerning Adjancote Hill, asserting estoppel. The Supreme Court found no error in the lower courts’ evaluation and affirmed that the plaintiff did not discharge the burden of proof on a balance of probabilities.",
