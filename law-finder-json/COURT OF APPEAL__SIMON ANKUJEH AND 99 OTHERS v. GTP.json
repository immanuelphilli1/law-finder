  "summary": "In Simon Ankujeh and 99 Others v. GTP, the applicants sought leave to adduce fresh evidence in the Court of Appeal during an ongoing appeal concerning end-of-service benefits. The fresh evidence aimed to establish that senior and junior staff were employed under different conditions of service, contradicting their consistent position in the High Court that all staff shared the same conditions. The Court of Appeal dismissed the application, citing Court of Appeal Rules (CI 19, rules 26 and 31), and relying on Sasu v. Amua-Sekyi, which holds that appellate courts must base decisions on evidence before the trial court. Introducing contradictory fresh evidence would transform the appellate court into a court of first instance. The court emphasized that the pending appeal concerned statutory interpretation of NLCD 157, ss.34 and 35, and NLCD 342, not service conditions, rendering the proposed evidence irrelevant to the legal issue at hand.",
