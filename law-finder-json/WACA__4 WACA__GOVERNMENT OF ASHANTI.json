  "caseTitle": "GOVERNMENT OF ASHANTI",
  "summary": "The West Africa Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by L.S. Bandoh and W.S. Bandoh (applicants) seeking to set aside a public auction sale of property executed under a writ of Fi Fa in favor of William Bu Achie (purchaser). The applicants, not parties to the original judgment, argued the sale was invalid due to lack of proper 14-day notice, absence of bidders, collusion between auctioneer and purchaser, under-value sale, and failure to notify them to settle the debt. The District Magistrate had set aside the sale, but the Supreme Court reversed, finding the applicants failed to prove substantial injury from the material irregularity (13-day notice). The Appeal Court upheld the Supreme Court, affirming that Rule 31 of Order 44 required proof of both material irregularity and substantial injury, which was not met. It emphasized that mere undervalue or familial connections did not invalidate the sale, and the auctioneer had no duty to notify third parties. The applicants were advised to pursue their property interest through separate legal action.",
