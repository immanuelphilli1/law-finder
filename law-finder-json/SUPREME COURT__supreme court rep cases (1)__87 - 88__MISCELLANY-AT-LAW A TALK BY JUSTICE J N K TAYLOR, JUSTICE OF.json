  "caseTitle": "MISCELLANY-AT-LAW A TALK BY JUSTICE J N K TAYLOR, JUSTICE OF",
  "summary": "This 1987–1988 address by Justice J.N.K. Taylor, a Supreme Court Justice of Ghana, explores the tension between traditional Anglo-Ghanaian common law principles and emerging socialist legality during a period of political flux under the Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC) regime. Justice Taylor critiques the rise of 'socialist legality,' where state or party policy supersedes codified law, undermining judicial independence and the rule of law. He highlights public misinterpretation of legal principles, exemplified by backlash against his comments on 'kalabule' (profiteering), and expresses concern over the establishment of parallel public tribunals that bypass traditional courts. The speech underscores a deepening schism within the legal profession, with some lawyers participating in these tribunals despite the Ghana Bar Association's opposition, threatening the coherence and integrity of Ghana’s legal system.",
