  "summary": "In F. & M. Khoury v. Jojo, the West African Court of Appeal held that the defendant, a trustee of an insolvent estate, was grossly negligent in failing to safeguard valuable personal effects belonging to the estate during a period of anticipated civil unrest, despite having insured his own goods against such risks but not the trust property. The court further found that the defendant's purchase of a trust property at public auction was fraudulent and void, as there was no evidence of a valid conveyance to the deceased's sister, and a trustee cannot legally purchase trust property. The defendant was ordered to account for the value of the missing trinkeys and to reconvey the property to the estate, along with accounting for rental income received since 1948.",
