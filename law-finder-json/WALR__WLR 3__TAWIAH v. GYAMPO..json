  "caseTitle": "TAWIAH VERSUS GYAMPO.",
  "summary": "In Tawiah v. Gyampo, the plaintiff, a subject of the Dapa Stool, appealed a Native Court decision denying his claim to a piece of stool land he had cultivated since 1941. He sought a declaration of usufructuary title, damages for trespass, and recovery of possession, asserting his rights both as a stool subject and as a descendant of a family granted land by the stool. The defendant stool claimed the land was cultivated by an 'abusa' tenant and that the plaintiff's rights were confined to a limited area. The High Court held that the plaintiff's cultivation and continuous possession created a presumption of a valid usufructuary interest under native custom. It emphasized that a stool subject's customary right to occupy and farm land is protected, even against the stool holding absolute title. The Native Court erred by allowing the stool's ownership to override the plaintiff's protected possession. The appeal was allowed, the lower judgment set aside, and the plaintiff's reliefs granted.",
