  "caseTitle": "GEORGIA HOTEL LIMITED VRS. SILVER STAR AUTO LIMITED",
  "summary": "In this 2012 Supreme Court of Ghana decision, Georgia Hotel Limited appealed a Court of Appeal ruling that reversed a High Court judgment awarding damages for alleged latent defects in a Mercedes Benz E240 Avant-garde purchased from Silver Star Auto Limited. The plaintiff claimed the vehicle had inherent manufacturing defects including engine noise, faulty sensors, and oil pump malfunction, rendering it unfit for use. The High Court found in favor of the plaintiff, citing latent defects and awarding €58,500, interest, damages for loss of use, and costs. The Court of Appeal reversed, finding insufficient proof of latent defects. The Supreme Court upheld the reversal, holding that the defects were not shown to be undiscoverable by reasonable inspection at delivery and that evidence pointed to operational or maintenance-related issues, particularly battery discharge, rather than inherent flaws. The Court emphasized that a second appellate court may independently assess conflicting factual findings and concluded the plaintiff failed to prove a manufacturing defect existing at the time of sale.",
