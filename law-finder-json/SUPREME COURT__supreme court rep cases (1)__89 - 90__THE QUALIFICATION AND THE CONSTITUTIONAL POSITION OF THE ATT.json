  "caseTitle": "THE QUALIFICATION AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION OF THE ATT",
  "summary": "This legal analysis examines the constitutional and historical evolution of the office of the Attorney-General in Ghana, focusing on its qualification requirements and institutional status. It traces the transformation from a colonial-era public service position, insulated from political change, to a political appointment under the 1960 Republican Constitution. Subsequent military regimes, including the NLC, NRC, and PNDC, introduced varying qualifications and attempted to reclassify the Attorney-General as a civil servant, notably through the Legal Service Regulations, 1983 (LI 1288). The article critiques the legality of these regulations, arguing that they improperly altered the constitutional status of the office via subordinate legislation. It analyzes the tension between the 'separate office' and 'combined office' models of the Attorney-General and Secretary for Justice, concluding that the combined model is more viable for Ghana's future constitutional framework. The piece underscores the importance of clarity in the appointment process, qualifications, and the balance between political accountability and professional independence.",
