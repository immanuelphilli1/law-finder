  "caseTitle": "ISAAC .T. PALMER",
  "summary": "This 1936 West African Court of Appeal decision addressed two legal questions referred by the Assistant Judge of the Warri Division. First, it confirmed that the Rules of Court established in 1928 under the West African Court of Appeal Order-in-Council applied automatically to Nigeria upon its inclusion in the Court's jurisdiction in 1934, despite changes in rule-making authority. Second, it held that the High Court may entertain a motion for conditional leave to appeal, affirming established litigant practice in the absence of specific procedural rules. The Court rejected both rulings by the Assistant Judge as incorrect, clarifying procedural rights in appellate practice across British West African territories.",
