  "summary": "The case R v. Vandi Gbou and Others (1939) involved three appellants convicted of the murder of Jassa in Sierra Leone. One counsel represented all three jointly indicted accused and called a defense witness, Morna Jonni, who alleged the prosecution's case was a conspiracy against all. The appeal challenged the denial of the last word to counsel for two appellants who did not call witnesses, claimed misdirection by the trial judge, and argued the verdict was against the weight of evidence. The West African Court of Appeal held that since one counsel represented all and called evidence benefiting all, it was proper to grant the Crown the final word. The court found no misdirection, upheld the finding that the appellants were principals in the second degree, and affirmed the conviction, citing R v. Burns and others. The appeals were dismissed.",
