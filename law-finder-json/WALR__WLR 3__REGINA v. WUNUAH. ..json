  "summary": "In Regina v. Wunuah, the appellant was initially convicted of murder for stabbing his wife during a struggle provoked by her insulting behavior after taking employment with a Syrian without his consent. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, holding that the trial judge erred in directing that the court must determine whether provocation actually deprived the accused of self-control, rather than whether it was likely to do so. The court emphasized the importance of considering the accused's community standards and way of life when assessing provocation. It further ruled that even if the accused's explanation is not accepted as true, if it might reasonably be true, the prosecution fails to meet its burden of proof. Consequently, the murder conviction was quashed and substituted with manslaughter, and the appellant was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment with hard labour.",
