  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC V THE HIGH COURT, KOFORIDUA EX-PARTE AUGUSTUS",
  "summary": "This is a civil motion brought before the Supreme Court of Ghana by Augustus Osae-Akonnor (Applicant) seeking to quash orders made by the High Court, Koforidua, presided over by Justice Kossi Efo Kaglo. The orders in question were issued ex-parte on 15th December 2008 and required the Applicant to surrender three vehicles or deposit $192,000 as security, alongside the issuance of an absconding warrant. The Supreme Court examined whether these orders violated the rules of natural justice, particularly the audi alteram partem principle, and whether the High Court acted ultra vires. It held that while the absconding warrant under Order 73 rule 1 was validly issued ex-parte, the order for interim preservation of property under Order 25 rule 2(1) required notice to the Defendant and could not be granted ex-parte. Since the Applicant had not been served or given a hearing, the preservation order breached procedural fairness and was therefore null and void. The Court issued an order of certiorari to quash the preservation order but did not interfere with the absconding warrant. The case underscores the importance of procedural due process in civil litigation, especially in ex-parte applications affecting fundamental rights.",
