  "caseTitle": "REX V THOMAS UDU",
  "summary": "The case REX v. THOMAS UDU, heard by the West African Court of Appeal on 2nd November 1939, involved an appellant who made a false report to the police in Aba, alleging his brother's death was caused by specific individuals performing rituals. The report, admitted as false by the accused, prompted a police investigation, wasting public resources and exposing innocent individuals to suspicion and arrest. The trial judge initially held that no offence was disclosed under Nigerian law, as common law misdemeanours were not applicable unless codified. The appellate court overturned this, ruling that the act constituted a common nuisance under section 234(f) of the Criminal Code, as it involved an unlawful act causing public inconvenience and prejudice. The court relied on Rex v. Elizabeth Manley to affirm that acts tending to public mischief are indictable. The appeal was allowed, and the conviction upheld.",
