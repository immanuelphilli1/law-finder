  "caseTitle": "REGINA v KWABENA KWANSAH",
  "summary": "In Regina v Kwabena Kwansah, the West African Court of Appeal quashed a manslaughter conviction because the trial judge improperly withdrew from the jury the question of whether a felony had been committed, which was essential to determining whether the killing was justified under section 61(1) of the Criminal Code. The accused claimed he shot the deceased in self-defense after finding him in his home armed with a cutlass and advancing toward him. The judge incorrectly stated there was no evidence of a felony, despite the possibility that the deceased’s conduct constituted a felony under section 310. The court held that the issue of felony was for the jury to decide, and the misdirection undermined the conviction.",
