  "caseTitle": "M. K. HINA WI & CO. VERSUS BASSIL.",
  "summary": "In M. K. Hina Wi & Co. v. Bassil, the plaintiff landlord sought to enforce a rent increase from £66 13s. 4d. to £92 per month, as determined by the Accra Rent Assessment Committee under the Rent Control Ordinance, 1952, during the currency of existing leases expiring in 1959 and 1964. The defendant tenant refused to pay the increased amount, arguing that contractual rent terms remained binding until lease termination. The Court of Appeal held that the Ordinance did not empower the Committee to override freely negotiated contractual rents during the lease term. The standard rent set under the Ordinance serves only as a maximum limit, not an enforceable minimum, and does not abrogate existing lease agreements. Therefore, the landlord could not recover the excess rent or obtain possession for non-payment of the increased amount. The decision emphasized that statutory provisions affecting vested contractual rights require clear legislative intent, which was absent here. The appeal was allowed, overturning the Land Court’s judgment.",
