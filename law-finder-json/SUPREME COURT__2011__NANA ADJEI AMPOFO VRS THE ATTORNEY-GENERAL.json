  "caseTitle": "NANA ADJEI AMPOFO VRS THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL",
  "summary": "In Nana Adjei Ampofo v. The Attorney-General & The President of the National House of Chiefs (Supreme Court, 2011), the plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of Section 63(d) of the Chieftaincy Act, 2008 (Act 759), which criminalizes the deliberate refusal to honor a chief's call to attend to an issue. The plaintiff argued that the provision violated the right to freedom of movement under Articles 14 and 21 of the 1992 Constitution, was vague, overbroad, and susceptible to abuse. The Supreme Court held that individual chiefs do not possess judicial powers under the Constitution, distinguishing their role as customary arbitrators from formal judicial functions. The Court rejected the argument that a chief’s call could be equated to a subpoena, emphasizing that arbitration requires consent. It further ruled that the institution of chieftaincy, while constitutionally guaranteed under Article 270(1), is not insulated from constitutional and statutory scrutiny and must conform to the rule of law. The provision was found to unjustifiably infringe on fundamental rights and was declared unconstitutional.",
