  "summary": "In Mawuli Kwao v. Roro Service (Gh.) Ltd., the plaintiff, a former seafarer, sued his employer for damages for personal injuries sustained aboard MV Kumasi in April 1991. He claimed he was injured during employment, paid medical expenses personally, and was later dismissed in 1996. The defendant argued the claim was statute-barred under the Limitation Decree, 1972 (N.R.C.D. 54), as the writ was issued in January 1998—over six years after the incident. The trial court dismissed the suit, and the Court of Appeal upheld the decision, finding no written acknowledgment of liability by the defendant as required under Section 17 of the Decree. The plaintiff's affidavits and letters showed repeated demands but no admission of fault or promise to compensate. The court rejected arguments of estoppel or equitable tolling, emphasizing strict compliance with statutory time limits. Thus, the appeal failed, and the plaintiff's claim was barred by law.",
