  "caseTitle": "KWESI MANKO AND ORS",
  "summary": "This 1936 West Africa Court of Appeal decision in Ghana dismissed consolidated appeals concerning ejectment, possession, and declaration of title over family land. The plaintiffs, claiming ownership of land and a two-storey house as heirs of Kojo Botsio, challenged a 1885 sale by Botsio to Bentil, arguing it was invalid due to lack of family consent. The court held that alienation of family land without consent is voidable, not void, and can be upheld if the family fails to timely challenge it under conditions allowing restitution. The court rejected the argument that rent-free occupation by Bentil (who married into the family) constituted acquiescence. However, continuous occupation of the upper floor by Bentil's successors from 1914 onward supported the validity of the title chain. The plaintiffs failed to meet the burden of proof for ejectment or title, and the appeals were dismissed, affirming the defendant's caretakers' possession.",
