  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case, Nova Complex Limited v Ghana Port & Harbours Authority, centered on the correct rate and application of post-judgment interest on a debt arising from a prior judgment. The respondent sought a garnishee order for unpaid interest, arguing that post-judgment interest should be calculated using the U.S. dollar prime rate, not the Bank of Ghana's rate, and that the Court (Award of Interest and Post Judgment Interest) Rules 2005 (CI 52) applied. The appellant contended that applying CI 52 retroactively to the 2004 High Court judgment was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court unanimously rejected this, holding that CI 52 applies from the date of the final appellate judgment (2006), not the trial judgment (2004), thus avoiding retroactivity. It affirmed that post-judgment interest under CI 52 applies automatically from the date of the final judgment until payment and that the Court of Appeal was correct in ordering interest on the dollar component at the prevailing U.S. rate. The Court also clarified that Article 107 of the Constitution, which restricts retroactive laws, does not apply to court rules made under Article 157(2).",
