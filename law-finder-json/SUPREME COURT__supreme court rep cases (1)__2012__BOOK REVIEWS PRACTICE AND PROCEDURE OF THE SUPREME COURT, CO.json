S., highlights the book's comprehensive coverage of civil procedure across Nigeria's 20 distinct High Courts, noting the author's effective organization of complex material into six rule sets. The work is praised for its practical utility to legal practitioners, with detailed commentary on procedural rules, court forms, and constitutional provisions under the 1979 Nigerian Constitution.
