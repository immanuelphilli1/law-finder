  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC VRS THE HIGH COURT, CAPE COAST EX PARTE GHANA",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana was called upon to determine whether Justice Tanko Amadu had jurisdiction to vary an earlier order made by Justice Kwofie, who was on leave, granting a stay of execution and installment payments in a civil judgment debt case. The applicant, Ghana Cocoa Board, argued that the variation order was made without jurisdiction and thus null. The Supreme Court held that Justice Amadu did not improperly assume jurisdiction, as the application was not a review but a variation sought due to ambiguity in the original order. The Court found that the variation did not contravene procedural rules, particularly Order 42 Rule 4 of C.I. 47, and affirmed that a judgment creditor may seek clarification or modification of an ambiguous order. The application to quash the variation order was dismissed.",

    "Justice Amadu did not lack jurisdiction to hear the variation application despite Justice Kwofie being on leave.",
    "Order 42 Rule 4 prohibits review applications when a judge is on leave for less than three months, but this was a variation, not a review.",
    "The variation sought clarification of an ambiguous order and did not improperly alter the original judgment.",
    "A judgment creditor may apply for variation if an order creates ambiguity or practical difficulty.",
    "The Supreme Court emphasized that no appeal was pending, distinguishing the case from functus officio principles.",
    "The original stay and installment terms were largely affirmed; only the default clause was modified.",
    "The Court found no jurisdictional overreach, as the judge acted within procedural bounds.",
    "The applicant failed to demonstrate that the variation was ultra vires or procedurally flawed."
