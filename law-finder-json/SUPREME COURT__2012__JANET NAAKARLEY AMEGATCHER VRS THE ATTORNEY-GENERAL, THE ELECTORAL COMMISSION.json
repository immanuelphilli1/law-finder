  "caseTitle": "JANET NAAKARLEY AMEGATCHER VRS THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL, THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION",
  "summary": "In Janet Naakarley Amegatcher v. Attorney-General & Electoral Commission (Supreme Court, 2012), the plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of provisions in the Local Government Act, 1993 (Act 462) that empowered the President to unilaterally declare new districts and assign names via executive instrument. The Supreme Court held that Article 241(2) of the 1992 Constitution vests the power to redraw district boundaries or reconstitute districts exclusively in Parliament through legislation, not the President. The Court found Section 1(2) of Act 462 inconsistent with the Constitution and therefore void, emphasizing that district creation is a legislative function requiring parliamentary deliberation to prevent partisan abuse. The judgment reinforced constitutional limits on executive power and affirmed Parliament’s role in local government restructuring.",
