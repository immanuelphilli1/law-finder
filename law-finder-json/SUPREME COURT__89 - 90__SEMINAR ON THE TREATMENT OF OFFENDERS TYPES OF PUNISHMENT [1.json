  "caseTitle": "SEMINAR ON THE TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS TYPES OF PUNISHMENT [1",
  "summary": "This academic paper by Senah K.A., a lecturer in Sociology at the University of Ghana, explores the historical evolution of punishment across societies, from early tribal systems to modern penological practices. It distinguishes between public crimes (e.g., incest, witchcraft) and private crimes (e.g., murder, theft), noting that in traditional societies, punishment was often severe and aimed at appeasing supernatural forces or maintaining group survival. Public crimes were met with execution or ostracism, while private crimes triggered blood feuds under lex talionis. The paper reviews punitive methods such as flogging, mutilation, branding, stocks, and capital punishment, highlighting their brutality. It critiques contemporary imprisonment, especially in countries like Ghana, for continuing inhumane practices despite modern penology's emphasis on rehabilitation. The author concludes by advocating for a humanistic approach to offender treatment focused on reform rather than retribution.",
