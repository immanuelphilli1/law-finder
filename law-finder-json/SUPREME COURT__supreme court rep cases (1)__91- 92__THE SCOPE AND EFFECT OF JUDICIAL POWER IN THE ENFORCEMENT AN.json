  "caseTitle": "THE SCOPE AND EFFECT OF JUDICIAL POWER IN THE ENFORCEMENT AN",
  "summary": "This legal analysis examines the scope and effect of judicial power in enforcing and defending the 1992 Ghanaian Constitution, tracing its evolution through prior constitutions from 1957 to 1979. It highlights that judicial power is vested solely in the judiciary under Article 125(3), with the Supreme Court holding exclusive original jurisdiction over constitutional matters under Article 130. The paper reviews key cases such as Lardan v Attorney-General (No 2) and Ware v Ofori-Atta under the 1957 Constitution, illustrating how courts interpreted limited judicial powers, primarily reviewing legislation for compliance with specific constitutional restrictions. Under the 1960 Constitution, Re Akoto demonstrated judicial restraint despite constitutional provisions for judicial review. The 1969 and 1979 Constitutions expanded judicial authority, particularly in fundamental rights enforcement. The 1992 Constitution maintains similar structures but strengthens judicial independence and introduces disobedience of court orders as a high crime. The author argues that constitutional adjudication must balance legal interpretation with socio-political considerations to ensure democratic stability.",
