  "summary": "This Court of Appeal case from Ghana, Joseph Kotey v. Peter Kofi Kolete (CA No. 34/99, 23 December 1999), involved a dispute over the alleged sale of land at Ahiawom, Somanya. The plaintiff claimed specific performance of an agreement to sell a 100x100 feet plot, relying on a temporary receipt (Exhibit A) for ¢50,000 dated 22 August 1986. The defendant denied a binding sale, asserting the transaction lacked defined boundaries and was merely a right of pre-emption under customary law. The Court of Appeal held that the agreement was not a valid customary sale due to absence of essential elements like boundary marking and payment of 'frama'. It further ruled that Exhibit A did not satisfy the common law requirements under the Conveyancing Decree (N.R.C.D. 175), as it failed to identify the property with certainty and was unregistered under Section 24 of the Land Registry Act, 1962 (Act 122), rendering it unenforceable. The trial court’s judgment for specific performance was overturned. The defendant’s counterclaim was not substantively upheld, but his ownership was affirmed through a registered purchase deed (Exhibit 2) from 1978. The appeal was allowed, the plaintiff’s claim dismissed, and the counterclaim dismissed for lack of prosecution.",
