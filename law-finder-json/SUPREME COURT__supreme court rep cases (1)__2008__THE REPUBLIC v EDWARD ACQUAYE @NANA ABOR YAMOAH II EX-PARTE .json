  "summary": "This 2008 Supreme Court of Ghana decision in *The Republic v Edward Acquaye @Nana Abor Yamoah II, Ex-parte Charles Kwaku Essel & Ors* centers on a contempt of court appeal arising from a chieftaincy dispute. The case originated from a 1997 destoolment of Nana Abor Ewusie XIX by the Gomoa Akyempim Traditional Council, after which Edward Acquaye was installed as Nana Abor Yamoah II. A higher traditional council later set aside the destoolment and ordered a retrial. Subsequently, the High Court issued a prohibition order in 2001, directing that the status quo be maintained pending a properly constituted panel. The appellant sought to hold Acquaye in contempt for acting as chief during this period. The High Court found him guilty, but the Court of Appeal reversed, interpreting 'status quo' as preserving the state of affairs at the time—namely, Acquaye's enstoolment. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s interpretation, emphasizing that superior courts lack jurisdiction over chieftaincy matters as courts of first instance and must not expand their role beyond the issues presented. The appeal was dismissed, affirming that Acquaye’s conduct did not constitute contempt.",
