  "caseTitle": "AYISI VERSUS SAKYIAMABEA.",
  "summary": "In Ayisi v. Sakyiamabea, the plaintiff sought a declaration of title to land alienated to the defendant's predecessor in 1908, arguing that the sale lacked customary formalities and that the defendant's claim of a different source of title constituted denial of his family's ownership. The Native Court ruled for the plaintiff, holding that under Akan custom, vendors retain title after sale. The High Court reversed, clarifying that an unconditional alienation with payment, demarcation, and possession extinguishes the grantor's beneficial interest. It distinguished proprietary from jurisdictional rights, affirming that only the latter may persist post-alienation. The court also held that prolonged acquiescence over 49 years barred the plaintiff's claim via estoppel.",
