  "summary": "This 1939 Privy Council judgment concerns the administration of the estate of Tab Beigh, a trader from Bathurst, Gambia, who died in 1927. The case arose from a dispute between the deceased's widow, Ada Beigh (appellant), and executor Colin Shaw (respondent), over the handling of specific bequests under the will, including shop goods, a life interest in property, and a mortgage debt. The trial court found Shaw to be an unsatisfactory witness and held him liable for failing to transfer bequeathed assets, not collecting mortgage interest, and unilaterally using estate funds for property improvements without proper accounting. The West African Court of Appeal reduced the liability significantly, but the Privy Council reinstated key aspects of the original judgment, clarifying principles on executor accountability, indemnity for expenditures benefiting a legatee, and the duty to realize specific bequests. The final determination emphasized that executors must act diligently in administering bequests and account for profits derived from estate assets.",
