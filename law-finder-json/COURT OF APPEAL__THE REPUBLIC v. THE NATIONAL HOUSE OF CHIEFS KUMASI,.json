  "summary": "This Court of Appeal decision in Ghana concerns an appeal against a High Court ruling that refused an order of prohibition sought by the appellants, Nana Sakyi Akomeah II and Nana Abrokwa Gyampim IV, to prevent the National House of Chiefs from relying on its 1992 report regarding a chieftaincy dispute over the Akyem Aduasa stool. The dispute originated in 1982 and involved eligibility and customary law issues surrounding the enstoolment of Nana Abrokwa Gyampim IV. The National House of Chiefs conducted an inquiry under Section 3 of the Chieftaincy Act, 1971 (Act 370), following a request from the Chieftaincy Secretariat, and issued a report advising the government. However, the PNDC Secretary declined to act on it, citing lack of jurisdiction over matters of nomination and installation. The appellants later sought to block the use of the report in administrative decisions, particularly concerning the registration of the second appellant as chief. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that the National House of Chiefs was performing a statutory advisory role, not exercising original judicial jurisdiction, and that the report could not be treated as a binding judgment. The court emphasized that proper remedies were available through statutory appeal mechanisms under Sections 22(1) and 50(7) of Act 370, which were not pursued.",
