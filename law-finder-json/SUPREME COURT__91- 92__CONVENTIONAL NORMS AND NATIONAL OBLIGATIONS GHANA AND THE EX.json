  "summary": "This legal commentary examines the development of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) as an institution of international law, tracing its origins from the 1945 Truman Proclamation through the Third UN Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The EEZ, a 200-nautical-mile zone from a coastal state's baseline, grants sovereign rights over natural resources while preserving freedoms of navigation and overflight for all states. The article emphasizes that the EEZ is a sui generis legal regime, distinct from both territorial seas and the high seas. It highlights Ghana's early advocacy for the EEZ concept, particularly through Kenya and the Organisation of African Unity, and notes that Ghana has ratified UNCLOS. The paper critiques existing Ghanaian legislation for not fully conforming to UNCLOS obligations and calls for legislative reform to align national law with international commitments. It also discusses the 'common heritage of mankind' principle as foundational to equitable ocean governance.",
