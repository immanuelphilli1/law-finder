  "caseTitle": "NANA KWAKU AMOAH",
  "summary": "This appeal arose from a dispute between the Stools of Asamangkese and Akwatia (plaintiffs-appellants) and the Omanhene of Akyem Abuakwa with members of the State Council (defendants-respondents) over the validity of a 1929 deed of submission to arbitration and the resulting award. The plaintiffs sought to set aside the deed and award on the grounds that the matters in dispute—particularly the Paramount Stool's claim to one-third of land rents from subordinate stools—were of a political or constitutional character under section 34 of the Native Administration Ordinance, and thus within the exclusive jurisdiction of the State Council, which could not delegate such authority. The West African Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. It held that the Ordinance did not bar arbitration of such matters, that the issue was res judicata following the Privy Council’s prior refusal to set aside the award, and that the plaintiffs were estopped from challenging the deed’s validity after having previously accepted it. The majority also found that the dispute was not inherently political or constitutional, and that the State Council acted only as a witness to the deed, not as a party. The appeal was dismissed with costs.",
