  "caseTitle": "2 ARABA TSETSEWA v JOSEPH DOBSON ACQUAH",
  "summary": "This 1941 West Africa Court of Appeal decision in Ghana (then Gold Coast) concerned a civil dispute over land ownership and trespass involving a cocoa plantation held under native tenure. The plaintiff, Araba Tsetsewa, sued the executors of Joseph Dobson Acquah's will for trespass after they removed cocoa from a plantation claimed under the will. The native tribunal found that Joseph Acquah had individually acquired the land through personal effort and gift from the chief, that the plantation was the one bequeathed in his will, and that the defendants knowingly trespassed on the devisee's rights. The Provincial Commissioner's Court reversed this, but the WACA restored the native tribunal's judgment, holding that its factual findings were supported by evidence and could not be disturbed without clear proof of error. The court emphasized the exclusive original jurisdiction of native tribunals in land matters under native tenure and affirmed that family assistance in farming does not automatically make property familial if the owner acted independently and made a valid will.",
