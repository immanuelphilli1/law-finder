  "summary": "The Republic v. The Fast Track Court, Accra, Ex-Parte Gariel Daniel is a constitutional case before the Supreme Court of Ghana concerning the eligibility of Justice D.K. Afreh to sit as an Additional Judge of the High Court after attaining the age of 65 and subsequently 70. The applicant argued that Article 145(2)(b) of the Constitution, which mandates retirement of High Court Judges at 65, disqualified Justice Afreh from such appointment. The Supreme Court rejected this, holding that Article 139(1)(c) permits the Chief Justice to request any Justice of the Superior Court of Judicature to sit in the High Court, irrespective of age, and that this provision is not subject to Article 145(2)(b). The Court further held that 'proceedings commenced' under Article 145(4) includes interlocutory rulings, not just full trial hearings, thereby allowing Justice Afreh to continue adjudicating cases initiated before his 70th birthday. The application was dismissed.",
