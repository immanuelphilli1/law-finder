  "summary": "In this criminal appeal before the West African Court of Appeal, the appellant challenged the validity of proceedings conducted on a public holiday, arguing that the Magistrate lacked jurisdiction, rendering the trial void. The court acknowledged that a public holiday is a dies non juridicus and that judicial proceedings should not be held on such days. However, it noted that the Magistrate sat at the express request of the defense to hear a witness who might not have been available later, and that the defense was fully heard. The court found no prejudice to the appellant and no substantial miscarriage of justice, especially since the irregularity benefited the defense. Applying the proviso to section 11 of the West African Court of Appeal Ordinance, the court dismissed the appeal, affirming that technical irregularities do not invalidate proceedings where justice has been substantially served.",
