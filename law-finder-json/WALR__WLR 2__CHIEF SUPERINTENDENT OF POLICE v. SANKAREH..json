  "caseTitle": "CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE VERSUS SANKAREH.",
  "summary": "In Chief Superintendent of Police v. Sankareh (1956), the Supreme Court of the Gambia addressed whether a magistrate could disqualify an individual from driving after conviction for failing to produce a driving licence under the Motor Traffic Ordinance, s. 70, when the trial was conducted under the Trial of Petty Criminal Cases Ordinance, c. 25. The appellant was convicted and sentenced to a fine and twelve-month disqualification. On appeal, the court held that section 5 of the Trial of Petty Criminal Cases Ordinance strictly limits permissible punishments to imprisonment up to one month, fines up to £5, or corporal punishment up to twelve strokes, with only additional orders for restitution, confiscation, or forfeiture allowed. Since disqualification was not among the listed penalties and did not fall under the proviso, the court ruled the disqualification order ultra vires. Applying the principle of strict interpretation of penal statutes, the court concluded that the legislature's omission of disqualification indicated its exclusion. The appeal was allowed, and the disqualification order was quashed.",
