  "caseTitle": "APERADE STOOL VERSUS ACHIASI STOOL",
  "summary": "This appeal arose from a decision by the Reserve Settlement Commissioner in favor of Achiasi Stool regarding ownership of Block I within the Bemu River Forest Reserve. Aperade Stool had previously litigated a broader claim to land including Block I, which was dismissed by the Privy Council due to insufficiently defined boundaries and lack of precise evidence. The Commissioner held that Aperade were estopped by the prior judgment from asserting title to Block I. On appeal, the Court of Appeal considered whether res judicata or estoppel applied. The majority held that since the subject-matter (Block I) was only a part of the earlier claim, there was no identity of subject-matter required for estoppel per rem judicatum. Granville Sharp J.A. emphasized that the evidence needed to prove the current claim differed from that in the prior case. Ollennu J. dissented, arguing that allowing piecemeal litigation after a full adverse judgment would undermine finality. The appeal challenged the exclusion of new documentary evidence, which the Commissioner rejected as barred by the earlier decision. The core legal issue centered on the interpretation of 'identity of subject-matter' in res judicata.",
