  "caseTitle": "COMMERCIAL BANK PENSIONERS ASSOCIATION v. GHANA",
  "summary": "The Court of Appeal of Ghana considered an appeal arising from a dispute between the Ghana Commercial Bank Pensioners Association and the Ghana Commercial Bank Ltd over the computation of pension entitlements. The pensioners sought payment based on the bank’s 1987 Board decision to adjust pensions according to current basic salaries and automatic adjustments when salaries change. The trial court had ruled that a 1992 Ministry of Finance circular, which mandated pensions be calculated at 50% of consolidated salary, applied to the bank. The Court of Appeal reversed this, holding that the circular applied only to public servants and not to the bank, a commercial entity. However, the Court found that 'basic salary' should be interpreted as 'consolidated salary' because the former had been effectively abolished since 1991. It was inconsistent for the bank to pay current employees on a consolidated basis while denying the same to pensioners. The Court also addressed procedural irregularities, noting the trial court failed to enter formal judgment, which was later rectified by the Supreme Court’s orders of certiorari and mandamus. The case was ultimately remitted for proper accounting and enforcement consistent with the appellate directives.",

    "The Ministry of Finance circular on consolidated salaries did not apply to the Ghana Commercial Bank as it is a commercial entity, not part of the public service.",
    "The concept of 'basic salary' ceased to exist after the adoption of consolidated salary in 1991, making it illogical to use outdated structures for pension calculations.",
    "The Court relied on WUAKU v. Attorney-General to affirm that 'basic salary' should be interpreted as 'consolidated salary' in post-1991 contexts.",
    "The bank's continued use of consolidated salary for current employees but not pensioners was deemed inconsistent and unfair.",
    "The trial court failed to enter formal judgment, necessitating remittal and later correction via Supreme Court intervention through certiorari and mandamus."
