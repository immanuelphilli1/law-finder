  "caseTitle": "MANSOUR VERSUS SUKUMAL.",
  "summary": "In Mansour v. Sukumal, the High Court of the Western Judicial Division in Ghana considered whether a new lease existed after the expiration of an initial seven-year lease. Although the parties had executed a written lease with a proposed rent, they subsequently agreed to refer the rent determination to the Rent Assessment Committee and abide by its decision. The Committee initially set the rent at �1,207 10s. per annum, but this was later reduced to �600 per annum by the District Magistrate. The landlord sought possession under section 11(1)(e)(i) of the Rent Control Ordinance, claiming the tenants were statutory tenants. The court held that a complete agreement existed due to the method of rent determination, constituting a valid lease. Thus, the tenants were not statutory tenants, and the landlord could not rely on the Ordinance to recover possession. Judgment was entered for the defendants.",
