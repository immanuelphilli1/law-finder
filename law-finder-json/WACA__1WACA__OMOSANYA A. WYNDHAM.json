  "caseTitle": "OMOSANYA A. WYNDHAM",
  "summary": "In this appeal before the West African Court of Appeal, the lower court had invalidated a mortgage sale on the grounds that the registered money-lender failed to describe himself as such in the mortgage deed, allegedly breaching section 4(1)(b) and (c) of the Money-lenders Ordinance, Cap. 129 of 1924. The appellate court reversed the decision, holding that merely omitting the word 'money-lender' did not amount to using a name or description other than the registered one. The court emphasized that the mortgagee used his correct name and address, thus complying with the law. Citing R. v. Tugwell, it ruled that a total omission of description is not an inaccurate description. The court found no basis for invalidating the transaction, as no deception was involved and solicitors are expected to exercise due diligence regardless. The appeal was allowed, the sale was restored, and costs were awarded to the appellant.",
