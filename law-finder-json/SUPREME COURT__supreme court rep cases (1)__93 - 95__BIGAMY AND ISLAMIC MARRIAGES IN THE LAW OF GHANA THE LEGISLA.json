  "summary": "This legal analysis examines the intersection of bigamy laws and Islamic marriages in Ghana, focusing on whether a Muslim marriage contracted during a subsisting monogamous marriage constitutes bigamy under Ghanaian law. The article draws on the Privy Council decision in *Attorney-General of Ceylon v Reid*, where a man's conversion to Islam and subsequent polygamous marriage was held not to amount to bigamy due to the recognition of personal law changes in pluralistic societies. In contrast, Ghana's Criminal Code (Section 263) criminalizes any second marriage during the subsistence of a prior marriage, without distinguishing based on validity or religious personal law. The author highlights the lack of clarity in Ghanaian law regarding whether 'customary marriage' includes Islamic marriage, the absence of prosecutions, and the tension between indigenous polygamous norms and imported monogamous legal frameworks. The analysis concludes that Ghana's rigid bigamy law remains underdeveloped and socially dissonant, particularly in its failure to address the status of Muslim marriages explicitly.",
