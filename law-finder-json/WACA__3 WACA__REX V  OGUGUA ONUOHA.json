  "caseTitle": "REX V OGUGUA ONUOHA",
  "summary": "The appellant, Ogugua Onuoha, was convicted at trial for preparation for coining under section 148(2) and 148(3)(c) of the Criminal Code, based on the discovery of counterfeit coins and 34 moulds in an open shed within his compound. The prosecution failed to establish a direct link between the accused and the criminal act, as the shed was accessible to others due to a broken fence, and the incriminating items were not concealed. There was no evidence of mens rea, guilty knowledge, or active participation. The West African Court of Appeal held that, under section 10(1) of the West African Court of Appeal Ordinance, 1933, the conviction could not be sustained given the lack of compelling evidence and the presence of reasonable doubt. The appeal was allowed, and the conviction was quashed.",
