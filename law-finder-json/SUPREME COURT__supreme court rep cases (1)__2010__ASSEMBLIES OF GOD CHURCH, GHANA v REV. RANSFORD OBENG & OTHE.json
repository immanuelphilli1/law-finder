  "caseTitle": "ASSEMBLIES OF GOD CHURCH, GHANA v REV. RANSFORD OBENG & OTHE",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case involved a dispute between the Assemblies of God Church, Ghana (plaintiff/respondent) and five former leaders of the Calvary Charismatic Centre (CCC), led by Rev. Ransford Obeng (defendants/appellants), following the CCC's unilateral decision to sever denominational ties in 1992. The plaintiffs sought declarations affirming their ownership of the church property, recovery of possession, and injunctions against interference. The High Court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, declaring that the seceding members ceased to be part of the church and that the properties belonged to the national church under a trust doctrine. The Court of Appeal affirmed this with expanded declarations, and the Supreme Court upheld the decision. The court emphasized that while members have the right to secede, church property acquired during affiliation is held in trust by the national body and cannot be retained by seceding factions. The judgment also highlighted the spiritual and moral implications of such disputes within Christendom.",
