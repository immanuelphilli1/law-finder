  "summary": "In Adjei and Boame v. The Nkomihene and Another, the plaintiffs—chiefs within the Volta River Federation—were arrested and prosecuted for insulting behavior toward a chief after presenting a memorandum to the State Council asserting their equal status and challenging the authority of the Nkomihene. The prosecution was initiated by the defendants, one of whom presided over the Native Court that convicted the plaintiffs. The convictions were later quashed on appeal. The West African Court of Appeal held that the prosecution was malicious, lacking reasonable and probable cause, particularly due to the conflict of interest and procedural impropriety. The trial judge's finding of lawful and bona fide prosecution was overturned, and the case was remitted for assessment of damages.",
