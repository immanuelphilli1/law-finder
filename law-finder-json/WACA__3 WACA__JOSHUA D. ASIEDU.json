  "caseTitle": "Tay v. Williams",
  "summary": "This 1937 West Africa Court of Appeal decision in Accra, Ghana, addressed an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Provincial Commissioner. The appellant, Joshua D. Asiedu, challenged the jurisdiction of that court on two grounds: (a) failure to obtain leave to appeal from the Paramount Chief's Tribunal, and (b) a discrepancy in the date of judgment cited in the notice of appeal. The court rejected the second ground, applying the principle from Kojo Pan v. Atta Fua that a minor error in date does not invalidate an appeal if the actual judgment is identifiable. However, it upheld the first ground, ruling that the Provincial Commissioner lacked jurisdiction because the appellant had not obtained leave from the trial tribunal and there was no formal refusal that would have empowered the appellate court to grant leave. Consequently, the appeal was allowed, the Provincial Commissioner’s judgment was reversed, and the original decision of the Paramount Chief's Tribunal was restored.",
