  "summary": "In this 2006 Supreme Court of Ghana case, Alhaji Mahmoud Braimah, representing the family of the late Alhaji Mahmoud Mustapha Ali, sued Hajia Cedi Amarke over the ownership of property located at E.47/12, Nima, Accra. The property was the self-acquired asset of the deceased and passed to all his children, both natural and adopted, upon his death. The appellant claimed ownership based on a sale conducted by the deceased's eldest son and two uterine sisters, excluding two adopted sons. The court found the sale invalid due to lack of consent from all rightful heirs and the respondent's failure to conduct proper due diligence. Relying on equitable principles, including constructive notice and the maxim against benefiting from wrongful conduct (actio ex turpi causa), the court dismissed the appeal, affirming that adopted children have equal inheritance rights and that a prudent purchaser must investigate known encumbrances.",
