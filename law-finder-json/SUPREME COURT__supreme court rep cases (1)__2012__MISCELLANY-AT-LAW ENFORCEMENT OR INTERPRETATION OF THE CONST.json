  "caseTitle": "MISCELLANY-AT-LAW ENFORCEMENT OR INTERPRETATION OF THE CONST",
  "summary": "This legal commentary discusses the circumstances under which a matter qualifies as one of 'enforcement or interpretation of the Constitution' under article 118(1)(a) of the 1979 Ghana Constitution, as clarified by the Court of Appeal in Republic v. Special Tribunal; Ex parte Akosah. The court held that such an issue arises when constitutional language is ambiguous, when parties offer rival interpretations, when there is conflict between constitutional provisions, or when institutional operations under the Constitution conflict. However, if the constitutional language is clear and unambiguous, the matter does not require Supreme Court intervention under its original jurisdiction; instead, any alleged misinterpretation may be addressed through normal appellate procedures. The decision emphasizes that mere application of clear constitutional provisions to facts is within the trial court's purview and does not warrant Supreme Court original jurisdiction.",
