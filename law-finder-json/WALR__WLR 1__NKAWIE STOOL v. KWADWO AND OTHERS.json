  "summary": "The case of NKAWIE STOOL v. KWADWO AND OTHERS involved an appeal from a Land Court judgment that non-suited the plaintiff with liberty to bring a fresh action. The defendants appealed this decision to the West African Court of Appeal, but a preliminary objection was raised that the order was interlocutory and thus required special leave to appeal, which had not been obtained. The court held that an order dismissing an action without prejudice to re-filing does not finally determine the rights of the parties and is therefore interlocutory. Relying on Isaacs & Sons v. Salbstein, the court applied the test of whether the judgment finally disposes of the parties' rights, concluding that it does not. As special leave was not obtained, the appeal was struck out.",
