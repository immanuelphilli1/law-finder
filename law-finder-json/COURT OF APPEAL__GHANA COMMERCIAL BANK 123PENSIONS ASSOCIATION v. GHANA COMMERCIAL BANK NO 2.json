  "caseTitle": "COMMERCIAL BANK PENSIONS ASSOCIATION v. GHANA COMMERCIAL",
  "summary": "In this Court of Appeal ruling, the plaintiff/respondent, Ghana Commercial Bank Pensions Association, sought a stay of execution of a writ of sequestration issued by the High Court following a judgment from June 2002. The original judgment declared that the plaintiffs were entitled to pension rights under the bank's 1987 Board decision. However, on appeal, the Court of Appeal had previously ruled on 11th July 2002—based on a Supreme Court remit—that the parties must first negotiate the percentage of consolidated salary to be used for pension calculations, citing an internal review mechanism. The respondent attempted enforcement via sequestration before this condition was met. The appellants argued that enforcement was premature. The Court found that the negotiation order was not obiter but a binding directive arising from a substantive ground of appeal, and thus the High Court erred in issuing the writ. Consequently, the Court granted the stay of execution pending appeal, emphasizing the existence of serious legal issues to be resolved.",
