  "caseTitle": "OHIMEN VERSUS ADJEI AKD",
  "summary": "This case involved a dispute between a family and their stool over the right to alienate stool land. The plaintiff, representing his family, sought a declaration of title, an injunction, and damages for trespass, arguing that the stool could not alienate land occupied by the family without their consent. The Supreme Court of Ghana held that while the stool holds an absolute estate in stool land as trustee for its subjects, subjects in occupation hold a determinable estate that cannot be alienated by the stool without their consent. The court rejected the notion of prescriptive title through long possession, affirming that undisturbed possession does not vest ownership but laches may estop the true owner from recovering land if they have unreasonably delayed. The Native Court's findings were overturned on grounds of legal misdirection regarding res judicata and the effect of long possession. The judgment clarified key principles of customary land tenure, including the nature of estates, requirements for alienation, and the fiduciary duties of stools toward their subjects.",
