  "summary": "In this 1937 West Africa Court of Appeal case, Agnes Sawyer appealed her conviction for perjury on two counts, arguing that the trial judge misdirected the jury by failing to instruct them that they must acquit if there was reasonable doubt. The trial judge had expressed disagreement with the guilty verdict, believing the evidence insufficient, and had summed up in favor of the accused. However, he omitted to clearly state that the benefit of any reasonable doubt should go to the accused. Relying on B.R. Lawrence v. The King (1933) A.C. 699, the appellate court held that such an omission constitutes a grave error, equivalent to misdirection, undermining the fundamental principle that prosecution must prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Since the trial judge himself doubted the conviction, it could not be said that a properly directed jury would have reached the same verdict. Consequently, the appeal was allowed, the convictions were quashed, and acquittals were entered.",
