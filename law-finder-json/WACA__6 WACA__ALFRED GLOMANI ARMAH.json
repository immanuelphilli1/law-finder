  "caseTitle": "ALFRED GLOMANI ARMAH",
  "summary": "This 1940 West Africa Court of Appeal decision in Accra concerned the appeal of Alfred Glomani Armah against a conviction for an unspecified offense involving coins. The court addressed the prosecution's failure to call Adamu, an eye-witness to the central transaction, noting it was a matter of severe comment but not fatal to the conviction. The case hinged on whether coins found in the possession of the first prosecution witness were the same coins given by the appellant. Despite two assessors finding the appellant not guilty, the trial judge convicted based on discrepancies in the appellant's statements and supporting evidence. The appellate court upheld the conviction, finding sufficient basis for the trial judge's decision and dismissed the appeal.",
