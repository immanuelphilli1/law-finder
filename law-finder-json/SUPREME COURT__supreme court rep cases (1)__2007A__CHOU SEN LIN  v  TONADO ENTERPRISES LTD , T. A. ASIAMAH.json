  "caseTitle": "CHOU SEN LIN v TONADO ENTERPRISES LTD , T. A. ASIAMAH",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case, decided on 31st October 2007, concerned a land dispute over three plots (LI 1, 2, 3) in Tema originally leased by the Tema Development Corporation (TDC) to W. C. Tandoh in 1974. The plaintiff, Chou Sen Lin, acquired Tandoh’s interest in the land, registered it, and constructed factories on two plots. The defendants, Tonado Enterprises Ltd and T. A. Asiamah, encroached on the third plot, claiming ownership based on a 1976 allocation and payment of ground rent. The Circuit Court initially ruled for the defendants, but the Court of Appeal reversed, granting title to the plaintiff. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision, finding that the plaintiff’s interest predated the defendants’, that the TDC’s allocation to the defendants was an error, and that payment of ground rent did not establish ownership. The defendants’ appeal was dismissed.",
