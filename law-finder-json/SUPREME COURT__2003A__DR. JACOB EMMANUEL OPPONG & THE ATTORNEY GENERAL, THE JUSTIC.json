  "caseTitle": "DR. JACOB EMMANUEL OPPONG & THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, THE JUSTIC",
  "summary": "Dr. Jacob Emmanuel Oppong, former Deputy Chairman of the National Commission for Civic Education (NCCE), was removed from office in 1999 following an investigation by the Justice George K. Acquah Committee into alleged 'stated misbehaviour' under Articles 146(1) and 236 of the 1992 Constitution. He filed a suit in the Supreme Court under its exclusive original jurisdiction (Article 130(1)(a)) seeking declarations that the removal standards were unconstitutionally applied, that the procedure was flawed, and requesting nullification of his removal, reinstatement, and damages. The Supreme Court, per Justice Bamford-Addo, held that the case was实质ially one for reinstatement and appeal of a committee's findings, not a genuine constitutional interpretation issue. It ruled that such matters fall outside the Court’s original jurisdiction and must instead be pursued via appeal to the Court of Appeal under Article 280(2), which treats adverse inquiry reports as High Court judgments. The preliminary objection was upheld, and the action was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.",

    "The Supreme Court lacks original jurisdiction over claims that are essentially for reinstatement and damages, even if couched as constitutional interpretation.",
    "A matter involving challenge to findings of a committee of inquiry must be appealed to the Court of Appeal under Article 280(2), not brought directly to the Supreme Court.",
    "The phrase 'stated misbehaviour' is not inherently ambiguous and does not require Supreme Court interpretation in this context.",
    "Invoking the Supreme Court’s original jurisdiction to bypass lower courts undermines the judicial hierarchy and proper appellate process."
  ],
  "confidenceNotes": "The ruling is clear and consistent with established precedent on the limits of the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction. The constitutional provisions and case law are accurately cited and applied.",
