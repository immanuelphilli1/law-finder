  "summary": "This West Africa Court of Appeal decision from 1941 concerned a dispute over customary land rights in Ghana. The defendants, descendants of a domestic servant of the plaintiffs' ancestor, had leased family land to a third party for thirty years without the plaintiffs' consent. The plaintiffs claimed forfeiture of the defendants' customary occupancy rights due to misbehaviour. The defendants initially claimed fee simple ownership and raised defences of long possession, laches, and acquiescence, but abandoned the title claim. The court upheld the trial judge's finding that leasing the land under claim of ownership constituted a direct challenge to the overlord's rights, amounting to misbehaviour and forfeiture under native law and custom. The court emphasized that not every lease results in forfeiture, and each case must be judged on its facts. The appeal was dismissed with costs.",
