  "caseTitle": "REX v BAUNA OF GEJI",
  "summary": "The West Africa Court of Appeal, on 17 October 1936, allowed the appeal of Bauna of Geji, who had been convicted of murder. The court held that while the appellant had seriously maltreated an elderly woman who died shortly afterward, the prosecution failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the maltreatment caused or accelerated her death. There was no medical evidence supporting the causal link between the acts and death, and the maltreatment, while serious, was not inherently life-threatening except through shock to an aged person. Additionally, the trial court wrongly admitted inadmissible hearsay evidence. Due to insufficient proof of causation, the conviction was quashed and an acquittal entered.",
