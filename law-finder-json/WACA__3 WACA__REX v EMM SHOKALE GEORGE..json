  "caseTitle": "REX v EMM SHOKALE GEORGE.",
  "summary": "The appellant, Emanuel Shokale George, was convicted for attempting to procure the forgery of currency notes under Section 8A of the West African Currency Notes Ordinance. The prosecution relied on a letter (Exhibit A) posted from Shagamu, Nigeria, addressed to a U.S. firm, requesting the purchase of a fraction of currency notes with a British postal order, and a copy of the letter (Exhibit B) found at the appellant's house, with expert testimony confirming both were identical. The defense argued there was no case to answer, claiming the letter was merely an enquiry and that proof of receipt was required to establish attempt. The trial court and the West African Court of Appeal rejected these arguments, holding that posting alone suffices for an attempt and that 'currency notes' in the Nigerian context refers to West African currency notes. The appeal was dismissed.",
