  "caseTitle": "REX v KOFI MARFO",
  "summary": "This is an appeal from a murder conviction in Ashanti, Ghana, where Kofi Marfo was tried alongside Yaw Frimpong before a judge and assessors. The assessors were divided in their opinion: one found guilt, one found the case not proved, and one found the accused not guilty. The trial judge convicted under section 260 of the Criminal Procedure Code. On appeal, the West African Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and quashed the conviction, holding that the evidence did not meet the required standard of proof for murder. A key factor was the 14-day delay by eyewitnesses in reporting the crime, which introduced a reasonable doubt, consistent with the views of two assessors. The court also noted that the appellants should have had separate trials due to inimical defences.",
