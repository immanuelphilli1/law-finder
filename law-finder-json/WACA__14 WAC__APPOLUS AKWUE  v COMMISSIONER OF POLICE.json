  "caseTitle": "APPOLUS AKWUE v COMMISSIONER OF POLICE",
  "summary": "This case, decided by the West African Court of Appeal, addressed the jurisdiction of a third-grade magistrate under sections 20 and 21 of the Magistrates' Courts Ordinance. The central issue was whether a third-grade magistrate was required to inform the appellant of his right to be tried in the Supreme Court for charges carrying a maximum penalty of a £50 fine or six months' imprisonment. The court held that such notice was not required because the offence fell within the category that a third-grade magistrate could try without the accused's consent, as the maximum penalty did not exceed two years' imprisonment or a £200 fine. While a third-grade magistrate may try such offences, their sentencing power is limited to a maximum of three months' imprisonment or a £25 fine. The court affirmed the prevailing interpretation of the Ordinance, emphasizing the distinction between trial jurisdiction and sentencing authority, and answered the referred question in the negative.",
