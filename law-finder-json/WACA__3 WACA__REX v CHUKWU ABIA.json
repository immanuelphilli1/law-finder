  "caseTitle": "REX v CHUKWU ABIA",
  "summary": "The West Africa Court of Appeal quashed the convictions of Chukwu Abia and Obasi Okoronwe for slave dealing due to insufficient particulars in the charges, which created ambiguity about the factual basis of the prosecution. The case hinged on two distinct possible sets of facts: one involving an attempt to pledge or sell a child in Aro-Chuku, and the other involving the placement of the child with a relative for upbringing. The court held that the charges failed to specify which act constituted the offence, preventing a fair trial. Additionally, the Crown’s shifting legal stance during appeal underscored the uncertainty. Without clarity on which facts were proven or relied upon, and lacking evidence that the child was treated as a slave or pledged for debt, the convictions could not stand.",
