  "caseTitle": "REX V PETER KALLE",
  "summary": "The appellant, Peter Kalle, was convicted on two counts of fraudulent false accounting and stealing under sections 438(a), (b) and 390(6) of the Criminal Code. On appeal, the West African Court of Appeal quashed the conviction on the first count due to duplicity, as it combined multiple distinct offences under different subsections into a single charge without separate counts. However, the appeal against the second count was dismissed. The court held that although there were technical defects in the charge—such as naming individual owners of the property when the law deems money received on behalf of another as belonging to the principal—these did not cause prejudice given the appellant had adequate notice of the charges. The court applied the proviso to section 10(1) of Ordinance 47 of 1933, affirming that no substantial miscarriage of justice occurred. The appellant's argument that he was punished thrice for the same offence was rejected as a confusion between civil and criminal liability. His sentence, which ran concurrently, was not deemed excessive. The facts and the appellant’s own statement pointed clearly to guilt, with his defense being more an appeal for leniency based on age and following superior orders.",
