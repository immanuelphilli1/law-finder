  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC VRS HIGH COURT(LAND DIV.),ACCRA EXPARTE ATTORNEY GENERAL SWEATERS & SOCKS FACTORY LTD, HABIB GEORG 20TH FEBRUARY, 2013",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana ruling from 20th February 2013 addressed whether the High Court has jurisdiction to attach public funds to satisfy a judgment debt owed by the State. The case arose after the High Court issued a Garnishee Order Absolute directing the Bank of Ghana to pay the cedi equivalent of USD 28,595,600 to Sweaters & Socks Factory Ltd and Habib George Beany, following a 32-year denial of use of their factory by the State. The Attorney-General, representing the Republic, sought to quash the order, arguing that the Constitution and financial laws barred courts from ordering withdrawal of public funds without parliamentary appropriation. The Supreme Court reaffirmed its earlier precedent in Republic v High Court (Commercial Division); ex parte Attorney-General, holding that the High Court does have jurisdiction to enforce judgment debts against the State through garnishee proceedings. It rejected the argument that Articles 177 and 178 of the 1992 Constitution prevent such execution, emphasizing that a judgment debt creates a constitutional obligation for the State to pay, necessitating the executive to secure required authorization. The Court stressed that the lack of a specific budget line for judgment debts does not exempt the State from liability, drawing an analogy to private individuals who must satisfy court-ordered payments regardless of personal budgeting. The ruling upheld the rule of law and the State’s duty to honor financial obligations, reinforcing judicial authority in enforcing judgments against the government.",
