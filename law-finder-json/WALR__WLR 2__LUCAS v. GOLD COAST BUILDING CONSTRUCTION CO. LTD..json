  "caseTitle": "LUCAS VERSUS GOLD COAST BUILDING CONSTRUCTION CO. LTD.",
  "summary": "The plaintiff, an employee of the Gold Coast Building Construction Co. Ltd., sued for damages for wrongful dismissal after failing to comply with two directives: handing over his work to another employee and attending a directors' meeting. He claimed the instructions were unreasonable due to insufficient notice. The court held that even if the orders were unreasonable from the employer's perspective, they were not unlawful, and the plaintiff had no valid excuse for disobedience. The court emphasized that employees must obey lawful and reasonable orders, and wilful refusal constitutes misconduct, justifying summary dismissal. The claim failed, and judgment was entered for the defendant with costs.",
