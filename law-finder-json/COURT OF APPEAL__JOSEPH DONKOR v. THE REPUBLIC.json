  "caseTitle": "JOSEPH DONKOR v. THE REPUBLIC",
  "summary": "Joseph Donkor appealed his conviction for careless driving under Section 18(1) of R.T.O. 55/52 and negligently causing harm under Section 72 of the Criminal Code, following a collision on the Cape Coast-Takoradi Road. The Court of Appeal upheld the lower tribunals' rulings, finding that Donkor drove without due care when his articulated tanker entered the lane of an oncoming Mercedes Benz, causing it to catch fire. Key evidence included a signed accident sketch placing the point of impact in the victim’s lane, the appellant’s initial police statement corroborating this, and mechanical inspection confirming vehicle operability. Despite claiming emergency evasive action due to a third vehicle, the court held that the peril was self-created through inadequate caution. The appeal was dismissed, affirming both conviction and sentence.",
