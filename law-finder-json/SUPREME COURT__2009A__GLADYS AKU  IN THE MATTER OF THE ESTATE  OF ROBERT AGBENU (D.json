  "caseTitle": "GLADYS AKU IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF ROBERT AGBENU (D",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana allowed an appeal in a property dispute concerning the estate of Robert Agbenu, who died intestate in 1979. The plaintiff claimed co-ownership of a property with the defendant, his alleged sister, while the defendant asserted sole ownership based on a registered title document (Exhibit A). The trial court dismissed the plaintiff's claims, relying solely on the defendant's registered title, while the Court of Appeal reversed that decision without sufficiently evaluating the evidence. The Supreme Court found that both lower courts failed to properly assess the evidence as required by established precedents. It noted procedural irregularities, including the inclusion of an unrelated court judgment in the record. Due to the failure of both courts to make adequate factual findings and the resulting confusion, the Supreme Court set aside both judgments and ordered a retrial before a differently constituted Circuit Court.",
