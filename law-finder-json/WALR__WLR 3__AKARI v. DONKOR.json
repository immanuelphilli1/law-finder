  "caseTitle": "AKARI v. DONKOR.",
  "summary": "In Akari v. Donkor, the plaintiff, a newly enstooled chief, sought to compel the defendant, a stool-subject occupying inherited stool land, to enter into a new tenancy agreement with increased annual tribute from £1 4s. to £2 8s. The defendant had lawfully succeeded his uncle and paid the agreed tribute following a reduction approved by the plaintiff's predecessor, accompanied by a customary 'aseda' (thank-offering). The Native Court initially ruled for the plaintiff, but on appeal, the High Court held that a stool cannot unilaterally abrogate or vary the terms of a customary tenancy agreement lawfully entered into by a predecessor. The court emphasized the inheritable and determinable nature of a stool-subject’s estate, which is held on fixed customary dues, distinguishing it from agreements with non-subjects. The appeal was allowed, the Native Court’s judgment was set aside, and the plaintiff’s claim was dismissed.",
