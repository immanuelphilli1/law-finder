  "caseTitle": "NATIONAL BISCUIT CO. VERSUS PIONEER BISCUIT CO., LTD",
  "summary": "The National Biscuit Company, a U.S.-based corporation, opposed the registration of the trademark 'PIBISCO' by Pioneer Biscuit Company, Ltd. in Ghana, arguing that the mark was phonetically and visually similar to its own 'NABISCO' mark and would cause public confusion. The opposition relied on sections 12 and 24 of the Trade Marks Ordinance. The court found that 'NABISCO' was not registered in Ghana, so protection under section 24 was unavailable. While acknowledging phonetic and visual similarities, particularly in the dominant 'BISCO' syllable, the court held that for opposition under section 12 to succeed, there must be evidence that the Ghanaian public was familiar with 'NABISCO' as identifying the opposer's goods. However, the only evidence showed limited imports between 1944 and 1947, with no presence in Ghana for the prior ten years. Without proof of continued recognition or market impact, the court concluded that confusion was unlikely and ordered the registration of 'PIBISCO'.",
