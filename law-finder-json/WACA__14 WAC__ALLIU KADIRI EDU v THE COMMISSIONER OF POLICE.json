  "caseTitle": "ALLIU KADIRI EDU v THE COMMISSIONER OF POLICE",
  "summary": "In this 1952 West African Court of Appeal case, Alliu Kadiri Edu, a Post Office employee in Lagos, was acquitted of stealing a suspected postal packet but later charged under section 173(2) of the Criminal Code with negligently losing the same packet. He pleaded not guilty and during trial, his counsel submitted that a second trial was barred by autrefois acquit. The Magistrate overruled the submission, convicted him, and the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal. On further appeal, the Court held that the facts required to prove stealing are distinct from those needed to prove negligence under section 173(2), and thus the two charges could not have been joined or tried alternatively under section 161 of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance. The Court also ruled that section 181 should be interpreted by omitting the non-existent 'sub-section (1)' reference, but this did not benefit the appellant as the offences were not the same. Additionally, the Court found that the appellant’s act of giving his cupboard keys to assistants, despite departmental instructions, constituted negligence. The appeal was dismissed.",
