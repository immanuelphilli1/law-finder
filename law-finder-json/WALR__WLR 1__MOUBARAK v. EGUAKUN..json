  "summary": "In Moubarak v. Eguakun (Supreme Court of the Gold Coast, January 31, 1956), the defendant, a tenant on a monthly tenancy in Sekondi, defaulted on rent payments for September and October 1955. The plaintiff landlord sought recovery of possession under s. 11(1)(a) of the Rent Control Ordinance, c. 2 of 1952. The defendant paid the September rent before service of summons and October rent on the returnable date. The District Magistrate granted possession, citing prior default in June 1955. On appeal, Windsor-Aubrey J held that the Ordinance was intended to strengthen tenant security, not weaken it. The court emphasized that s. 11(1) is not automatically triggering; discretion must be exercised. Given the tenant's eight-year history with only two isolated defaults, both linked to financial strain, and full arrears payment before or on the hearing date, the circumstances did not justify forfeiture. The magistrate's failure to consider s. 11(3), which allows discharge of an order upon payment within a reasonable time, was a material oversight. The appeal was allowed, the possession order set aside, and the defendant awarded costs of appeal, though liable for costs at first instance due to initial arrears.",
