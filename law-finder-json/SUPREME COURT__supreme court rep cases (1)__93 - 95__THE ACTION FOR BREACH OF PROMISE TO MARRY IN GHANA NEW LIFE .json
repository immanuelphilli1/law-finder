  "caseTitle": "THE ACTION FOR BREACH OF PROMISE TO MARRY IN GHANA NEW LIFE",
  "summary": "This academic article by Mensa-Bonsu H J A N examines the survival and potential modern application of the common law action for breach of promise to marry in Ghana. Though discredited and abolished in jurisdictions like England and Wales, the action remains part of Ghana's received law. The author analyzes its doctrinal basis, noting it is treated as sounding in contract by Ghanaian courts, though it has tort-like features. The article outlines the elements: a mutual promise to marry, breach by refusal or incapacity, and presumed damages. Defences are narrow, including illegality, unchastity (if undisclosed), and serious illness. Damages may be compensatory (for mental distress, loss of reputation, economic loss), aggravated (for improper conduct like false allegations), or punitive (for fraud or malice). The author argues that reviving the action could empower individuals, especially women, to protect their rights in personal relationships, countering the view that it encourages extortion. The piece concludes that while the action has controversial origins, its principled application in Ghana could serve justice in appropriate cases.",
