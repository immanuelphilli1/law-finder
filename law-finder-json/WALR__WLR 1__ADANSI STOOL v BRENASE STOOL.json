  "caseTitle": "ADANSI STOOL v BRENASE STOOL",
  "summary": "The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council dismissed an appeal by the Adansi Stool against the Brenase Stool concerning a declaration of title to land in Ashanti, Ghana. The Supreme Court of the Gold Coast and the West African Court of Appeal had both dismissed the claim, finding that the appellant failed to prove a root of title or exclusive possession. The Privy Council upheld the concurrent findings of fact, applying the principle that it will not re-examine evidence unless there is a miscarriage of justice or a violation of a fundamental legal principle. The appellant argued that Exhibits 3 and 6—renunciations by the Brenase Stool of rights to land—entitled them to succeed, but the Board held that a plaintiff must prove their own title. The argument that the Government held the land in trust for Adansi Stool was rejected as it was raised for the first time on appeal and contradicted the appellant's original case. The trial judge's refusal to grant an adjournment to call a traditional historian was found to be within judicial discretion. The appeal was dismissed with costs.",
