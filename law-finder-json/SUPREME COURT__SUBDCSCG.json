  "summary": "This document compiles multiple civil judgments from Ghana's Supreme and High Courts, primarily concerning estate administration, testamentary capacity, and contractual disputes. Key issues include whether a deceased had capacity to devise family property via will, distribution of estates under the Intestate Succession Law (PNDCL 111), and the application of res judicata in barring relitigation of estate administration rights previously decided in 1955. Other cases address abuse of judicial process, enforcement of agreements, wrongful termination of dealership contracts, and execution of judgment debts involving third-party property. The courts consistently upheld procedural fairness, legal capacity, and finality of judgments while interpreting contracts and estate laws.",
