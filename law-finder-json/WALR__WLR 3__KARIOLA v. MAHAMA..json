  "caseTitle": "KARIOLA VERSUS MAHAMA.",
  "summary": "In Kariola v. Mahama, an action for conversion of kola nuts, the plaintiff successfully sued the defendant despite the defendant's prior acquittal in a criminal larceny case. The High Court of Ghana, Central Judicial Division, held that a previous criminal acquittal does not bar a civil claim for conversion. Relying on Section 147(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, c. 10 of 1951, the court confirmed that the plaintiff's right to bring civil proceedings remained valid as the suit was filed within six months of the magistrate's restitution order. The court also affirmed the general legal principle that criminal judgments are inadmissible as evidence in subsequent civil proceedings. The plaintiff proved ownership and was awarded ₤84 as damages.",
