  "caseTitle": "LAGOS EXECUTIVE DEVELOPMENT BOARD",
  "summary": "This 1940 West African Court of Appeal decision involved the Lagos Executive Development Board appealing a lower court ruling that awarded compensation to the Olorogun Family without trial. The Board claimed it had already acquired the land via statutory notice under section 53 of the Lagos Town Planning Ordinance (No. 45 of 1928), not that it was seeking acquisition. The lower court used an originating summons under sections 44 and 45, mislabeled parties, and ruled for the defendants without evidence, citing res judicata from a prior Crown judgment. The appellate court held that an originating summons was procedurally inappropriate, that the Respondents bore the onus to prove entitlement to compensation, and that the prior judgment against the Crown did not bind the Board as a separate legal entity. The appeal was allowed, pleadings were struck out, and the case remitted for trial with clarified procedure and burden of proof.",
