  "summary": "In Hadmoris Co. Ltd. v. F. Y. Kyere, the Court of Appeal of Ghana considered whether interest should have been awarded on the full amount of 54 million cedis claimed in the writ of summons, rather than only on 29 million cedis as ordered by the trial judge. The appellant argued that the trial court erred in limiting interest despite the defendant's conduct effectively admitting liability, including partial payment into court. The Court of Appeal held that under The Courts (Award of Interest) Instrument (LI 1295), interest must be awarded on the entire sum found due, especially where the defendant's actions amounted to an admission of the claim. Relying on precedent and principles of justice, the court ruled that a party who wrongfully withholds funds should not benefit from their use during litigation. Consequently, the appeal succeeded, and the court substituted the interest award to apply to the full 54 million cedis from the date of the writ to the date of judgment at the prevailing bank rate.",
