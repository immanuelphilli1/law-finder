  "caseTitle": "REPUBLIC v. THOMAS ASARE EX-PARTE NAA TWAA KOFI",
  "summary": "In this Court of Appeal ruling, the applicant, Thomas Asare, appealed a finding of contempt and sentence imposed by the Tema High Court in a civil proceeding. The High Court had found him 'guilty' and imposed a fine or alternative imprisonment, part of which was to compensate the applicant. Asare appealed to the Civil Division and sought a stay of execution, which was denied at the trial level. Before the Court of Appeal, the key issue was whether the contempt was civil or criminal, affecting the proper appellate procedure. The respondent argued the matter was quasi-criminal and should have gone to the Criminal Division with a bail application. The Court held that despite the use of 'guilty' and 'sentence,' the context—especially the award of costs—indicated civil contempt. Thus, the appeal to the Civil Division was valid. While a formal 'stay of execution' was procedurally improper due to the nature of the penalty, the court exercised its inherent jurisdiction under CI. 19 Rule 7 to suspend enforcement pending appeal, avoiding irreparable harm.",
