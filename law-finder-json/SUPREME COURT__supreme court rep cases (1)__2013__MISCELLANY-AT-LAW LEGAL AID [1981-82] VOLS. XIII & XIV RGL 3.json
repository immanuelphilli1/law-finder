  "summary": "The document discusses the importance of legal aid for indigent and illiterate persons in Ghana, emphasizing the underutilization of Section 110(2) of the Courts Act, 1971 (Act 372), which allows Circuit and District Courts to assign legal representation with the Chief Justice's approval when it serves the interests of justice. The author commends Taylor J. (as he then was) for invoking this provision in Kpekobo v. The Republic (unreported, 14 August 1979, High Court, Bolgatanga), highlighting the judiciary's role in preventing injustice. The second part honors Mr. E. Kofi Tetteh’s retirement as Editor of the Ghana Law Reports, recognizing his pivotal role in establishing the independent Council for Law Reporting under Act 366 (1971) and N.R.C.D. 64 (1972), improving law reporting standards, staff training, and publication regularity.",
