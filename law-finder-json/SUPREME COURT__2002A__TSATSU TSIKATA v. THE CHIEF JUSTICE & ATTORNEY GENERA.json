  "caseTitle": "TSATSU TSIKATA v. THE CHIEF JUSTICE & ATTORNEY GENERA",
  "summary": "The case of Tsatsu Tsikata v. The Chief Justice & Attorney-General (Writ No. 6/2002, Supreme Court of Ghana, 2002) centered on constitutional challenges to a Practice Direction issued by the Acting Chief Justice on 10th January 2001, which mandated the empaneling of at least seven or eleven justices in constitutional matters and reviews. The plaintiff, a citizen and litigant in a prior case, sought declarations that the Practice Direction was unconstitutional, infringing on Articles 125(4), 128(1), 128(2), and 133(2) of the 1992 Constitution. He also challenged the Chief Justice’s role in constituting benches in a case where he was a party, raising bias concerns under natural justice. The Supreme Court dismissed preliminary objections, affirming the binding precedent in Akufo-Addo v. Quashie-Idun and Kuenyehia v. Archer, which uphold the Chief Justice’s statutory duty to empanel benches regardless of personal interest, absent legal bias. The Court held that mere party status does not disqualify the Chief Justice from administrative functions and that the Attorney-General is constitutionally empowered to represent the Chief Justice in official capacity suits under Article 88(5). The core constitutional issues regarding the Practice Direction were not resolved in this judgment, as the ruling focused on preliminary procedural objections.",
