  "caseTitle": "A G. v AJISEG IRI",
  "summary": "This appeal from a judgment against sureties on a bond for a licensed auctioneer arose under the Sales by Auction Ordinance. The defendants, M. A. Ajisegiri and A. W. Olukolu, were sureties for J. A. Williams, who sold property at John Street to Oduntan without authority from the mortgagees after an abortive auction. Oduntan obtained judgment against Williams for misrepresentation and recovery of money paid, which remained unsatisfied. The Attorney-General sued the sureties on the bond alleging non-compliance with the Ordinance. The trial court held that Williams breached section 22 by selling privately after an abortive auction and ruled against the sureties. On appeal, the West African Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, holding that section 22 does not prohibit such a sale if proper authority is obtained, and no breach was established. It further held that section 9, requiring a bond for faithful discharge of office, was not breached as the bond was in prescribed form and no statutory violation was proven. The court emphasized that the sureties were not liable absent a demonstrated breach of the Ordinance's provisions.",
