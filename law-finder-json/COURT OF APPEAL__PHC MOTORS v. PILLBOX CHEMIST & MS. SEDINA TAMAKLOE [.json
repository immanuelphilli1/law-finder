  "summary": "This Court of Appeal decision concerns an application for a stay of proceedings pending an interlocutory appeal on jurisdiction. The plaintiffs/respondents filed a claim for ₵10,295,000 in the Circuit Court, which at the time of filing had a jurisdictional limit of ₵10,000,000 under the Courts Act, 1963 (Act 459). The defendants/appellants challenged the court's jurisdiction, arguing the claim exceeded the limit and no express consent was given under section 41(3) of Act 459. The Circuit Court dismissed the challenge, asserting implied consent through conduct and later relying on the enhanced jurisdiction under Act 620, which raised the limit to ₵100 million. The Court of Appeal held that jurisdiction cannot be presumed from silence and that consent must be express. It further ruled that Act 620 could not be applied retrospectively to validate proceedings commenced before its effective date (1 December 2002), in line with Article 107(b) of the 1992 Constitution. Citing binding precedent, the Court found the Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction and granted a stay of proceedings pending the appeal.",
