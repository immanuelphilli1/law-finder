  "summary": "In this criminal appeal before the Supreme Court of Ghana, Nana Osei Kwadjo II was convicted for stealing revenue from Fahiakobo stool lands. Justice Kpegah, in a concurring opinion, found the conviction fundamentally flawed because the prosecution failed to establish a prima facie case, meaning the burden of proof never shifted to the appellant to enter a defence. He emphasized that under Section 15(1) of the Evidence Decree (NRCD 323), the burden of persuasion remains with the prosecution throughout. Furthermore, he held that the appellant's 'claim of right in good faith'—supported by an official letter (Exhibit 2)—constitutes a complete defence to stealing under Section 120 of the Criminal Code, as appropriation cannot be dishonest if the accused genuinely believes in their legal right to the property. Kpegah, J.S.C. dissented from the majority view (represented by Date-Bah, J.S.C.) and argued that the appeal should be allowed due to these legal errors.",
