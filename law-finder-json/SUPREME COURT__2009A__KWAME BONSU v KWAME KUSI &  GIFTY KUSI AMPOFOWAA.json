  "caseTitle": "KWAME BONSU v KWAME KUSI & GIFTY KUSI AMPOFOWAA",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision, delivered on 4th November 2009, affirmed the Court of Appeal's judgment in favor of Kwame Bonsu, the plaintiff-respondent, in a land dispute over Plot No. 10, Block VIII, Guggisberg Road, Adum, Kumasi. The plaintiff, representing the Nana Ama Serwah family, claimed the land was ancestral family property originally acquired in 1906 and wrongfully registered in the name of Michael Reginald Asante, a former family head. The defendants, Kwame Kusi and Gifty Kusi Ampofowaa, claimed ownership through purchase from Asante, asserting the plaintiff's delay in challenging the title amounted to acquiescence. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal's reversal of the trial court's decision, ruling that the defendants failed to comply with the mandatory procedural requirements of Sections 19 and 27 of the Land Registry Act, 1962 (Act 122) for proving registration. Despite the title deeds being in Asante's name, the Court found the plaintiff had discharged the evidential burden of proving family ownership through historical evidence. The appeal was dismissed by a 3-2 majority, affirming that non-compliance with statutory registration procedures invalidated the defendants' claim to title.",
