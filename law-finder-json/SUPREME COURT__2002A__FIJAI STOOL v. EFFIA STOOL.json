  "caseTitle": "FIJAI STOOL v. EFFIA STOOL",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision, delivered on 3rd July 2002, dismissed an appeal by Effia Stool against the demarcation of boundary lands in favor of Fijai Stool. The original dispute was adjudicated by the Stool Lands Boundaries Settlement Commission, whose decision was upheld by the Appeal Tribunal. Effia Stool appealed, arguing that the trial Commissioner erred in law by dismissing their traditional and documentary evidence and using inappropriate language. The Supreme Court confirmed that while the trial Commissioner's phrasing—calling Effia’s exhibits a 'pile or heap of waste papers in a dustbin'—was unjustified and unprofessional, it did not result in a miscarriage of justice. The court reaffirmed that the evidence, particularly the survey and traditional proof, overwhelmingly supported Fijai Stool’s claim. The Appeal Tribunal had independently evaluated the evidence and found Fijai’s case more convincing. The Supreme Court upheld concurrent factual findings, declined to substitute its own assessment, and dismissed the appeal.",
