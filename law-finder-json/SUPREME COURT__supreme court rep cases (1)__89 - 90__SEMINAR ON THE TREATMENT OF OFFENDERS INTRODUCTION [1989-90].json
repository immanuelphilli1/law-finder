  "caseTitle": "SEMINAR ON THE TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS INTRODUCTION [1989-90]",
  "summary": "In October 1989, the Judicial Service of Ghana organised a seminar on the Treatment of Offenders under the theme 'The Decongestion of Prisons,' prompted by widespread concerns over inhumane prison conditions, prolonged pre-trial detention, and excessive costs of incarceration. Former Chief Justice E.N.P. Sowah highlighted systemic issues including prison overcrowding, forgotten detainees, and abusive police practices. The seminar brought together judges, police, social workers, legal practitioners, and academics to examine custodial conditions, alternatives to imprisonment, and the broader objectives of punishment. The government sought expert advice to address these long-standing challenges in the criminal justice system.",
