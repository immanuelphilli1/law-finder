  "summary": "This document is a book review of 'Modern Law of Succession in Ghana' by A.K.P. Kludze, published in 1988, assessing its value for legal practitioners and law students. The review highlights the book's comprehensive coverage of wills, intestate succession, customary and statutory laws, including analysis of the Intestate Succession Law, 1985 (PNDCL 111), and marriage ordinances. It commends Kludze's critical engagement with prior scholarship and judicial decisions, his suggestions for legal reform, and his distinction between 'practised' and 'judicial' customary law. The reviewer notes several thought-provoking arguments, such as questioning the applicability of English law principles in Ghana and proposing amendments to inheritance rules. However, the review also identifies shortcomings, including typographical errors, omissions (e.g., on estate administration and registration under PNDCL 112), and overly lengthy discussions on certain theoretical points. Despite these flaws, the book is highly recommended for its scholarly depth and practical relevance.",
