  "caseTitle": "BASSIL VERSUS SAID RAAD",
  "summary": "In Bassil v. Said Raad & Sons, the Court of Appeal of Ghana overturned a trial court decision granting a landlord possession of leased premises and arrears of rent. The tenancy, originally for five years at £55 per month, saw rent reduced to £45 from January 1953. The landlord claimed this was temporary, but the defendant tenant produced receipts showing consistent acceptance of the lower amount. The appellate court held that the receipts indicated a binding variation of rent, supported by the doctrine of promissory estoppel. Additionally, the court ruled that under the Rent Control Ordinance, s. 11(1)(a), recovery of possession could not be granted where the lease lacked a re-entry clause for breach of covenant (e.g., unauthorized sub-letting), and that continued acceptance of rent waived any right to forfeiture. The appeal was allowed, denying the landlord’s claims.",
