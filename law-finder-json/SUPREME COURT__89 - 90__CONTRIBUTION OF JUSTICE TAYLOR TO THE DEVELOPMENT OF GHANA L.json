  "summary": "In Nkrumah v Manu (1970), Justice Kobina Taylor, then a High Court judge, delivered a landmark decision that challenged binding precedent and technical legalism in favor of substantive justice. The case involved a slander claim where the district magistrate awarded damages mislabeled as 'special damages.' Taylor refused to overturn the decision on this technical ground, criticizing undue reliance on form over substance. He re-examined the choice-of-law rules under paragraph 64 of the Courts Decree, 1966 (NLCD 84), rejecting the earlier Court of Appeal decision in Attiase v Abobbtey, which had ignored statutory changes. Taylor held that the applicable law must follow the statutory framework, requiring a plaintiff to explicitly claim customary law application. His analysis, though initially controversial and criticized by some judges, was later vindicated by the Court of Appeal in Kyei v Donkor, which endorsed his interpretation. This case established Taylor’s judicial philosophy: a purposive, policy-oriented approach that prioritizes justice over rigid precedent.",
