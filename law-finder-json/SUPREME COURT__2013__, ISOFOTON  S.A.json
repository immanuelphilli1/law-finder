  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana delivered a unanimous judgment in a constitutional case brought by Martin Alamisi Amidu, a former Attorney-General, challenging the validity of two international agreements between the Government of Ghana and Isofoton S.A., a Spanish company. The plaintiff argued that the agreements for solar energy and irrigation projects, executed in 2001 and 2005, constituted international business or economic transactions under Article 181(5) of the 1992 Constitution and were therefore void for lack of parliamentary approval. The Court agreed, holding that even though the underlying Spanish loan had been approved by Parliament, each specific transaction required separate laying before and approval by Parliament under Article 181(5). The Court further ruled that the High Court had acted without jurisdiction in interpreting constitutional provisions and granting consent judgments based on these void agreements. It declared the garnishee proceedings and related enforcement actions null and void. The Court affirmed the plaintiff’s standing under Article 2(1) to bring the action, despite parallel litigation by the Attorney-General. The judgment reinforced the supremacy of the Constitution and the necessity of strict compliance with procedural requirements in international transactions involving the state.",
