  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision in XL Insurance Switzerland Co. v. Gemini Maritime Services & Ghana Ports & Harbours Authority (2012) addressed whether an order setting aside a writ of summons was final or interlocutory, and whether time to appeal could be extended. The appellants, insurers and commodity traders, sued for damages arising from alleged negligence and breach of contract. The High Court dismissed the writ for non-compliance with section 92(2) of PNDC Law 160, which requires prior notice before suing the Ghana Ports & Harbours Authority. The appellants obtained an ex parte extension of time to appeal, but the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal as filed out of time, holding the order was interlocutory and the extension invalid. The Supreme Court affirmed that the order was interlocutory under the 'order approach' long established in Ghanaian law, meaning the appeal was subject to a 21-day limit under Rule 9(1)(a) of C.I. 19. It held that the exception for time extension in Rule 9(1)(b) applies only to final decisions, rejecting grammatical arguments based on punctuation. The Court also upheld the constitutionality of section 92(2) of PNDC Law 160.",
