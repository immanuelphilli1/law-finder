  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision in Frank Annor Boye-Doe v. Isaac Teye & Nii Ashong Omaboe (CA 13/98, 12th July 2000) addressed the validity of a High Court judgment delivered approximately two years after the presiding judge's retirement. The court held that under Article 145(4) of the 1992 Constitution, a retired Superior Court judge may only continue in office for up to six months after attaining the mandatory retirement age to conclude proceedings commenced before retirement. Since the judgment was delivered outside this six-month constitutional window by a different, sitting judge, the proceedings were deemed a nullity. The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, set aside the judgments of both the High Court and the Court of Appeal, and ordered the case remitted for a fresh trial de novo. The court declined to address other grounds of appeal, as this constitutional issue was dispositive.",
