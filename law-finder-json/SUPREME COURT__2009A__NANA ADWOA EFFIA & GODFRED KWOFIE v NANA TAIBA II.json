  "caseTitle": "NANA ADWOA EFFIA & GODFRED KWOFIE v NANA TAIBA II",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana judgment in a chieftaincy appeal (J2/1/2009) arose from a dispute over the ownership and kingmaking rights of the Royal Sewuah Paramount Stool of Bamiankor. The appellants challenged the National House of Chiefs' dismissal of their case, arguing procedural errors including reliance on extraneous matters, improper handling of a preliminary objection, and misapplication of rules regarding conditional appearance and reply. The core issue was whether an oral preliminary objection based on lis alibi pendens (a pending similar action) was properly raised without a formal motion. The Court emphasized that under Rule 28 of CI 27, Judicial Committees have discretion to determine procedure in the interest of justice, guided by customary law and High Court practice. It held that while formal rules do not strictly bind chieftaincy tribunals, they must ensure fairness and avoid manifest injustice. The Court found fault with the lower tribunals' reliance on counsel's arguments without independent review and cautioned against sua sponte findings not in the record. The appeal was allowed in part, underscoring the need for proper procedural adherence even in traditional forums.",
