  "caseTitle": "AH VERSUS FORFIE",
  "summary": "In this civil land title dispute, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council considered whether a judgment delivered by a judicial officer who lacked jurisdiction could be reviewed and validated. The presiding officer, Mr. Spooner, delivered a judgment on May 10, 1949, but his appointment had been rescinded effective that date. After being reappointed from June 23 to June 30, 1949, he reviewed his earlier decision on June 29, declaring the initial judgment void for lack of jurisdiction and reissuing it in identical terms. The West African Court of Appeal held both judgments nullities. The Privy Council reversed, holding that (1) a judgment given without jurisdiction is still a 'judgment' subject to review under Order 42 of the Courts Ordinance; (2) a judicial officer may review sua sponte, without a party's application; and (3) courts possess inherent power to set aside judgments lacking jurisdiction. Thus, the June 29 judgment was valid as it was issued during a period of lawful appointment.",
