  "summary": "This legal analysis examines the constitutional and institutional evolution of the office of the Attorney-General in Ghana from the colonial era through military and republican governments up to 1990. Initially a colonial public service position appointed by the Crown and not accountable to local assemblies, the Attorney-General became a political appointee under the 1960 Republican Constitution, subject to presidential direction. Subsequent military regimes (NLC, NRC, PNDC) alternated between treating the office as political or civil service, with some introducing minimum legal qualifications (e.g., 12–15 years at the Bar). The PNDC’s PNDCL 42 established a legal service and board, while LI 1288 purported to make the Attorney-General a public servant with enhanced qualifications—raising questions about the legality of such delegation. The article critiques the ambiguity between the roles of Attorney-General and Secretary for Justice, arguing that a combined office model is more functional than a separate office concept in Ghana’s constitutional framework.",
