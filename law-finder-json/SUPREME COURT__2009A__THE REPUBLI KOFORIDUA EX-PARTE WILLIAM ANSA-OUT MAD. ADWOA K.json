  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLI KOFORIDUA EX-PARTE WILLIAM ANSA-OUT MAD. ADWOA K",
  "summary": "The Republic, on the application of William Ansah-Otu and Mad. Adwoa Kwafoa, sought an order of certiorari from the Supreme Court of Ghana to quash a High Court ruling that granted an interlocutory injunction in favor of Koans Building Solutions Limited in a land dispute. The applicants argued that the High Court committed an error of law apparent on the face of the record by failing to require the interested party to give an undertaking to pay damages as mandated by Order 25, r 9(1) and (2) of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 2004 (CI 47), since the application was opposed. The Supreme Court held that while the trial court did err by not enforcing the mandatory requirement, the error was a procedural irregularity, not a jurisdictional defect, and thus not sufficient to warrant certiorari. Furthermore, the applicants had taken a fresh step by applying for a review of the injunction, which under Order 81, r 2(2) barred them from later challenging the irregularity. Consequently, the application was dismissed.",
