  "caseTitle": "DANIEL AWUNI v. WEST AFRICAN EXAMINATIONS COUNCIL",
  "summary": "The Court of Appeal in Daniel Awuni v. West African Examinations Council (2002) reviewed a High Court decision that had granted declaratory relief to 13 students whose SSSCE 2000 results were cancelled and who were barred for three years due to alleged examination malpractice. The applicants, represented by a next friend, argued that the cancellation and ban violated their fundamental rights and that they were denied natural justice, as they were never questioned or given a hearing. The High Court had ruled in their favor, ordering the release of results and lifting the ban. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the High Court lacked jurisdiction because the applicants improperly invoked Article 33(1) of the 1992 Constitution via an Originating Motion on Notice, which was procedurally flawed. The court emphasized that no clear fundamental right was violated and that proper legal procedures, such as filing a writ, should have been followed. Consequently, the appeal was allowed, and the High Court's judgment was set aside.",
