  "caseTitle": "JONAH v. LORD DUODU-KUMI,",
  "summary": "This Court of Appeal ruling in Ghana addresses a civil motion for stay of execution pending appeal in a landlord-tenant dispute. The plaintiff, Sam Jonah, obtained a summary judgment in the High Court for ejectment and rent arrears against tenant Lord Duodu-Kumi, who challenged the plaintiff's ownership and the legality of USD-denominated rent payments. The Court of Appeal upheld the summary judgment, holding that the tenant was estopped from denying ownership due to prior attornment via rent payments and that USD rent payments before January 1998 did not violate later Bank of Ghana foreign exchange regulations. The court found no triable issues warranting a full trial and rejected claims of irreparable harm, emphasizing that financial inability alone does not justify a stay of execution.",
