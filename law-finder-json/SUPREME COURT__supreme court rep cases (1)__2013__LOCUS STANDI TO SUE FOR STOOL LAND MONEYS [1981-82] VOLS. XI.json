  "caseTitle": "Gyamfi v. Owusu1 arose after stool",
  "summary": "The case of Gyamfi v. Owusu addressed the issue of locus standi to sue for compensation from stool land revenues in Ghana. The plaintiffs, representing the stool community, sued three individuals and the omanhene (paramount chief) for money received from the government for allegedly acquired stool lands. The Court of Appeal held that under the Administration of Lands Act, 1962 (Act 123), only state officers—specifically the Minister—had the legal authority to collect revenue from stool lands, thereby excluding private individuals, including chiefs, from suing for such moneys. The court also rejected the argument that the constitutional provision declaring stool lands held 'in trust' created enforceable common law trusts allowing beneficiaries to sue for an account. Additionally, it was found that the state had not validly acquired the land due to procedural failures under relevant statutes, meaning no compensation was legally payable. Despite sympathizing with the plaintiffs' position, the court allowed the appeal but ordered the disputed funds to remain in court pending lawful acquisition and proper disbursement through official channels.",
