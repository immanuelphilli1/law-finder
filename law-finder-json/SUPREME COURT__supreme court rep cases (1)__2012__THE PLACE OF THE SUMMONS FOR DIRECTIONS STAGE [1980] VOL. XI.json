  "caseTitle": "THE PLACE OF THE SUMMONS FOR DIRECTIONS STAGE [1980] VOL. XI",
  "summary": "This 1980 legal note by Nii-Aponsah D.A. emphasizes the critical role of the summons for directions stage in civil trials in Ghana. It argues that properly framed issues for determination are essential to ensure judicial objectivity, prevent miscarriages of justice, and maintain procedural fairness. The author critiques the oversimplification of issues—such as reducing land ownership disputes to a single question of who owns the land—because it allows judges unchecked discretion and undermines the need for specific factual findings. The note highlights that clear, precise issues guide the trial, limit irrelevant cross-examination, ensure express findings on contested points, and aid appellate review by distinguishing ratio decidendi from obiter dicta. Reference is made to Allotey v. Quarcoo, where the Court of Appeal faulted a trial judge for introducing new issues not pleaded, violating the principle that courts must not adjudicate on cases not presented by the parties.",
