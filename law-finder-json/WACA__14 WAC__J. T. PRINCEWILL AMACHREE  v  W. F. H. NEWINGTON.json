  "summary": "In this civil appeal before the West African Court of Appeal, nine Kalabari chiefs jointly sued a District Officer for damages arising from alleged false imprisonment and assault during a criminal investigation in 1950. The trial judge non-suited the plaintiffs, ruling that each plaintiff must sue separately as their claims for personal damages were distinct and could not be joined under Order 4, Rule 2 of the Supreme Court (Civil Procedure) Rules. The appellate court upheld the non-suit, holding that while plaintiffs may be joined when they share a common ground of action, the rule does not permit joinder of separate causes of action. Since each plaintiff's claim for false imprisonment and assault was personal and distinct, and no joint tort was established, the suit was improperly constituted. The court rejected reliance on post-1896 English procedural amendments, noting the Nigerian rule remained restrictive. Only three plaintiffs testified, and counsel's decision not to call the others supported the conclusion that the action was improperly treated as representative. The appeal was dismissed with costs.",
