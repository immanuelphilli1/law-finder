  "caseTitle": "BAFFOUR OSEI-AKOTO VRS. THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana, in Baffour Osei-Akoto v. The Attorney-General (2012), unanimously held that executive instruments used by the President to create districts under the Local Government Act, 1993 (Act 462) are not subject to the requirements of Article 11(7) of the 1992 Constitution. The plaintiff argued that such instruments—specifically E.I. 80, 81, and 82 of 2011—must be laid before Parliament, published in the Gazette, and remain for 21 sitting days before taking effect, as per constitutional provisions on Orders, Rules, or Regulations. The Court rejected this, distinguishing executive instruments from legislative subsidiary instruments, emphasizing that executive instruments are administrative or executive in nature and not legislative. Relying on the Interpretation Act, 2009 and the principle of *noscitur a sociis*, the Court concluded that Article 11(7) applies only to instruments of a legislative character. The decision reaffirmed the precedent in Amegatcher v. Attorney-General, confirming that district creation via executive instrument is a valid exercise of executive power, not subsidiary legislation.",
