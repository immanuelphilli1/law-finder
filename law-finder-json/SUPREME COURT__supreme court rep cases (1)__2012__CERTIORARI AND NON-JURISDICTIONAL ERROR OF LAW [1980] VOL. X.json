  "caseTitle": "In the case of Republic v. Special",
  "summary": "The case Republic v. Special Tribunal; Ex parte Forson (1980) involved an application for certiorari to quash a conviction by a Special Tribunal established under the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (Special Tribunal and Other Matters) Decree, 1979 (A.F.R.C.D. 23). The applicant, Forson, was convicted on two counts: obtaining an advantage through public office and acts intended to sabotage Ghana's economy, based on the Archer Committee report. He challenged the conviction on grounds of lack of jurisdiction, excess of jurisdiction, and error of law, particularly the admission of hearsay evidence. The core legal issue was whether section 7(2) of A.F.R.C.D. 23, which barred courts from questioning any decision of the Special Tribunal, effectively ousted the High Court’s supervisory jurisdiction under article 126 of the 1979 Constitution. Taylor J. dismissed the preliminary objection that the High Court lacked jurisdiction, conducting an extensive review of case law. However, the analysis concludes that despite the broad language of the ouster clause, the High Court retains jurisdiction to intervene where a tribunal acts without jurisdiction, exceeds its powers, or breaches natural justice. The article critiques Taylor J.'s failure to distinguish between partial and complete ouster clauses and notes that non-jurisdictional errors of law cannot be reviewed under complete ouster clauses, aligning with the Anisminic principle later affirmed by the Privy Council and House of Lords.",
