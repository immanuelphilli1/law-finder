  "caseTitle": "L. A. CARDOSO",
  "summary": "In this 1938 West Africa Court of Appeal decision, the appellants (executors of J.H. Doherty's estate) challenged a lower court judgment granting the respondent, L.A. Cardoso, a declaration of lifetime residence on estate property and an injunction against its sale. The appeal was allowed and a judgment of non-suit entered. The appellate court held that the lower court erred in granting relief without ensuring the order was consistent with the executors' fiduciary duties, noting absence of evidence regarding the will or estate's financial position. Additionally, the court found no valid consideration for the 1935 letter promising lifetime residence, as the plaintiff's claim was based on the deceased's wishes, not legal consideration. The argument of forbearance as consideration emerged only in cross-examination and was not pleaded, making it impermissible. The judgment was set aside on both procedural and substantive grounds.",
