  "caseTitle": "CHARLES MATEY v. CHALOTTE TEIKO SEMAHA & ORS.",
  "summary": "This appeal arose from a property dispute over House No. B.20, Asesewa, originally developed by the late Comfort Mateko, who raised the appellant, Charles Matey, and his siblings as foster children. The appellant claimed the property was jointly acquired with his mother, Yodjo, and that its sale by Comfort Mateko’s daughter and grandson to a third party was fraudulent. He sought declaration of title, nullification of the sale, and injunctive relief. The trial court dismissed his claim and granted the third defendant’s counterclaim for title. On appeal, the Court of Appeal upheld the decision, finding that the appellant failed to prove joint ownership or family property status. Documentary evidence (Exhibit B) showed Comfort Mateko alone paid for the land. The court rejected witness testimony supporting joint acquisition as inconsistent and implausible. Allegations of judicial bias were dismissed, with the appellate court affirming the trial judge’s thorough and impartial assessment of evidence. The sale was deemed valid, and the counterclaimant’s possession and renovations supported his claim to title.",

  "rationaleHighlights": [
    "The trial judge properly evaluated witness credibility and documentary evidence, particularly Exhibit B (receipt in Mateko's name only), undermining the claim of joint ownership.",
    "The plaintiff failed to prove that the property was family-owned or jointly acquired with Yodjo; the receipt showed sole payment by Comfort Mateko.",
    "The Court found no merit in allegations of judicial bias, noting the judge’s detailed and reasoned evaluation of conflicting testimonies.",
    "Customary adoption did not confer inheritance rights over property not formally devolved, and the plaintiff’s status as 'successor' was not legally substantiated.",
    "The sale by Comfort Mateko was upheld based on her undisputed ownership, and the counterclaim for title was validly granted."
