  "caseTitle": "IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF D",
  "summary": "In this 1940 West African Court of Appeal case concerning the estate of D. S. D. Odugua, the appellants (John Holt & Co.) sought an order under Order 51 Rule 2 of the Rules of the Supreme Court for the Deputy Sheriff to seize and secure the deceased's property. The lower court refused, ruling the rule applied only to property outside the court's jurisdiction. The appellate court held that the rule conferred power on the Supreme Court to act regarding property within its jurisdiction, interpreting 'any court' broadly. However, as Letters of Administration had already been granted to the widow, the appeal was dismissed as moot, though the court clarified the legal error in the lower court's jurisdictional interpretation.",
