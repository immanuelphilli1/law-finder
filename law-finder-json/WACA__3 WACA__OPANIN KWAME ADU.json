  "caseTitle": "OPANIN KWAME ADU",
  "summary": "This is a civil land dispute heard by the West Africa Court of Appeal on 18 December 1937, originating from the New Juaben Native Tribunal and appealed through the Provincial Commissioner's Court. The plaintiff-appellant, Opanin Kwame Adu, claimed ownership of a cocoa farm in Mpeiho, New Juaben District, based on a prior determination 16 years earlier that recognized his title and fixed boundaries. The Native Tribunal ruled in his favor, but the Provincial Commissioner's Court overturned this, awarding the land to the defendant, Kwasi Kuma, based on 16 years of undisturbed possession. The West Africa Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, holding that under native customary law, long undisturbed possession cannot extinguish an original title, and there is no concept of prescriptive title. The court emphasized that while long possession may serve as evidence of ownership, it cannot transfer title where an original title is proven. The judgment of the Native Tribunal was restored, and costs were awarded to the appellant in both appellate and native courts.",
