  "caseTitle": "SUPERVISORY JURISDICTION OF THE SUPREME COURT [1989-90] VOL.",
  "summary": "This legal analysis discusses the supervisory jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Ghana under Article 119 of the 1979 Constitution, which empowers the Court to issue prerogative writs such as certiorari, mandamus, prohibition, habeas corpus, and quo warranto over all courts and adjudicating bodies. The article examines key cases including Republic v High Court Registrar, Ex parte Yiadom, and Republic v High Court, Ex parte Quarcoo and Puplampu I, clarifying that while the Supreme Court has broad supervisory powers, applicants must first seek leave before filing for a prerogative order and cannot maintain parallel proceedings in lower courts. Although Ex parte Puplampu I initially imposed a six-month time limit for applications, this was later questioned in Ex parte Darke XII, where it was held that no strict time limit exists under the Supreme Court Rules, though delay may affect the discretionary grant of relief.",
