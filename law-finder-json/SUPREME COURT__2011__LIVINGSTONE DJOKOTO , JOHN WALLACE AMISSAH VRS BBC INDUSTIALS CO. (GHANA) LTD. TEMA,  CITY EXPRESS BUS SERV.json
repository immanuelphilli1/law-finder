  "summary": "The appellants, Livingstone Djokoto and John Wallace Amissah, sought a stay of execution of a High Court judgment allowing the sale of two properties owned by their former employer, City Express Bus Service Ltd., to satisfy a judgment debt. The properties were sold to BBC Industrials Co. (Ghana) Ltd. via public auction. The appellants, who occupied the houses, claimed beneficial ownership but failed to prove legal or equitable interest. The High Court dismissed their claim and ruled for the respondents. The Court of Appeal refused a stay of execution, citing no exceptional circumstances. The Supreme Court upheld this decision, finding no abuse of discretion, as the appellants did not demonstrate arguable points of law or that the appeal would be rendered nugatory. The appeal was dismissed.",
