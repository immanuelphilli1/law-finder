  "summary": "The West Africa Court of Appeal dismissed the appeals of four appellants convicted of robbery with violence under section 402 of the Nigerian Criminal Code. The conviction was based primarily on the testimony of Boke Bissong, an accomplice and participant in the attack, which required corroboration. The court found sufficient corroboration through the testimony of Ele Obi, who witnessed the appellants and Bissong together on the day of the attack, heard a gunshot, and was sent away by the men, with the third appellant later stating they were 'killing people.' Additionally, the portmanteau stolen from the victims was found in the fourth appellant's hut. The court emphasized that robbery under Nigerian law differs from English law, as it includes violence immediately before theft, even if the property is not taken directly from the person. The appellants' prior acquittal on murder charges did not preclude conviction for robbery arising from the same incident. The trial judge was found to have properly evaluated the need for corroboration and witness credibility.",
