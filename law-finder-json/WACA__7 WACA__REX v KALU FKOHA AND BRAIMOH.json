  "summary": "In Rex v Kalu Fkoha and Braimoh, the West Africa Court of Appeal allowed the appeal against convictions for contempt of court arising from alleged lying and prevarication during a criminal trial. The appellants were sentenced under section 41(1)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance without being formally charged with or given an opportunity to respond to allegations of perjury, as required by section 42. The court held that a prerequisite for committal under section 41(1)(b) is a finding of perjury, and that section 42 mandates the accused be informed of the charge, given specific assignments of perjury, and allowed to respond both substantively and in mitigation. As these procedures were not followed, the convictions and sentences were set aside. The court ordered judgments of acquittal and discharged the appellants.",
