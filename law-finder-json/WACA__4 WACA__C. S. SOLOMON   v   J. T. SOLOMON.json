  "summary": "In this West Africa Court of Appeal case, the plaintiff-appellant, C. S. Solomon, as administratrix of the estate of the late Sarkis Michael Solomon, brought a claim against the defendant, T. J. Solomon, for an account of partnership transactions and payment of any sum found due. A referee was appointed to examine the accounts. The trial judge, Baker, J., directed adjustments to the accounts, including the removal of certain debits from the deceased's personal account. However, when the report was later considered by Pearson, J. in Baker, J.'s absence, judgment was entered in favor of the defendant based on an incorrect interpretation of the accounts. The appellate court found that the proper judge to assess the referee’s final report was Baker, J., who was familiar with the case. The judgment of the lower court was set aside, the appeal allowed, and the matter remitted to Baker, J. for proper consideration of the referee's report. Each party was ordered to bear their own costs on appeal, with costs in the lower court to be determined by the judge handling the remitted proceedings.",
