  "caseTitle": "OHENE MOORE",
  "summary": "This Privy Council appeal from the Gold Coast Colony concerned whether the Provincial Commissioner had jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a Native Tribunal. The appellant, Ohene Moore, challenged the reversal of a Native Tribunal's judgment by the Provincial Commissioner, arguing that the appeal was improperly brought. The Native Tribunal had granted conditional leave to appeal, requiring the respondent, Akesseh Tayee, to deposit money and enter into bonds for costs. However, the bonds were conditioned for costs in the appellate court, not the original tribunal, and no actual payment or deposit satisfying the taxed costs in the first court was made. Section 77(2) of the Native Administration Ordinance required either payment or deposit of costs in the tribunal or appellate court before leave could be granted. The Privy Council held that this condition was mandatory and unmet, rendering the appeal a nullity. Thus, the Provincial Commissioner had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, and his judgment was set aside. The appeal to the Privy Council was dismissed, upholding the principle that jurisdictional requirements under statute must be strictly observed, even if it leads to a technically harsh outcome.",
