  "summary": "This 1940 West African Court of Appeal decision addressed whether a claimant could bring a fresh interpleader action after a prior action was struck out for non-prosecution. The court held that the striking out of the original action did not operate as res judicata, and the claimant retained the right to bring a new action, appeal, or apply for relisting or review. However, the court cautioned that repeatedly filing fresh actions to indefinitely delay enforcement would constitute an abuse of process. The judge’s additional statement refusing to relist the case was criticized as prejudging a future issue, potentially disqualifying him from ruling on any relisting application. Costs were awarded to the claimant.",
