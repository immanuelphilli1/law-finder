  "caseTitle": "A CRITIQUE OF SOME ASPECTS OF THE INSURANCE LAW, 1989 (PNDCL",
  "summary": "This legal commentary critiques key provisions of Ghana's Insurance Law, 1989 (PNDCL 227), focusing on its reform of common law principles in insurance. The author commends Section 52(1) for deeming insurance agents who complete proposal forms as agents of the insurer, thereby overturning the precedent in Newsholme Brothers v Road Transport and General Insurance Co Ltd, which disadvantaged insured parties, particularly the illiterate. However, the author strongly criticizes Sections 57 and 58. Section 57(1) is faulted for assuming the duty of disclosure rests solely with the insured and for creating ambiguity about the form of questioning. Section 57(2) is criticized for introducing a subjective test of intent that will lead to litigation. Section 58's adoption of a 'reasonable person' test for materiality is rejected in favor of the established 'prudent insurer' test, as it is deemed impractical for laypersons to assess materiality in complex insurance contexts. Finally, Section 59 is welcomed for limiting the harsh effects of 'basis of the contract' clauses and for restricting insurers' ability to avoid policies for immaterial breaches of warranty or condition.",
