  "caseTitle": "ASHAI AFUTU v. ROSELYN AKUELEY TETTEH, BEN ANNAN",
  "summary": "This Court of Appeal case in Ghana involves a paternity dispute where the plaintiff, Nii Ashai Afutu, sought a court order for medical testing to determine the paternity of a child born to the first defendant, Roselyn Akweley Tetteh, with whom he claimed a romantic relationship. The plaintiff also sought a declaration of biological fatherhood and damages against both defendants, including Ben Annan, who claimed to be the lawful husband of the first defendant under customary law. The trial court ordered blood tests for the plaintiff, the second defendant, and the child, but this ruling was appealed on the grounds that it was erroneous in law. The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge lacked jurisdiction to order the blood test, particularly on the child, since the plaintiff had not amended his writ to include such a request. The court emphasized constitutional protections against compelled bodily intrusion and found that the trial court erred in relying on untested affidavit evidence after the close of evidence. The appeal was allowed, the ruling set aside, and the trial judge directed to deliver judgment based on the existing evidence.",
