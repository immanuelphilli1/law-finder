  "caseTitle": "MICHAEL TETTEH v. EMMANUEL TETTEH SIKA & ANOR.",
  "summary": "This is an appeal from a Circuit Court judgment in a personal injury case arising from a motor vehicle accident during communal labour in Saisi, Odumase-Krobo. The plaintiff, Michael Tetteh, sustained serious injuries including urethral damage requiring a catheter after falling from a tipper truck (GR 9617D) owned by the second defendant and driven by the first defendant. He claimed damages for negligence, which the defendants denied, alleging he voluntarily jumped from the moving vehicle. The trial court found in favour of the plaintiff, awarding general and special damages. On appeal, the Court of Appeal upheld the finding of negligence and liability but set aside the award for past loss of earnings due to insufficient evidence that the plaintiff was actively earning as a driver (his licence had expired two years prior). However, the court recognized future loss of earnings and substituted an award based on the minimum daily wage for 12 months. The appeal was otherwise dismissed, with the court exercising discretion under CI 19 Rule 63 to consider additional grounds despite procedural non-compliance, as the respondent had already addressed them.",
