  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case, Dr. Kwabena Ntiri Riversom & 2 Ors v Yaw Siaw Addo (Civil Appeal No. J4/4/2005), arose from a dispute over ownership of a property in Agona Swedru purchased from the United Africa Company (UAC). The plaintiffs, administrators of the estate of the late Opanyin Yaw Koranteng, claimed ownership based on a 1972 Deed of Assignment in Koranteng's name. The defendant, son of Opanyin Kwame Addo (Koranteng’s uterine brother), argued that his father had financed the purchase and arranged for the property to be registered in Koranteng’s name to avoid public scrutiny, asserting a resulting trust. The trial court accepted the defendant’s version, but the Court of Appeal reversed, favoring documentary evidence and disinterested witnesses. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal, finding insufficient evidence to prove that Kwame Addo paid the purchase price on his own account, thus failing to establish a resulting trust. The appeal was dismissed.",

  "rationaleHighlights": [
    "The Supreme Court found insufficient evidence to prove that Opanyin Kwame Addo paid the purchase price on his own account, failing to meet the burden for a resulting trust.",
    "Documentary evidence, particularly the Deed of Assignment in Koranteng’s name, was given greater weight than oral testimony.",
    "The Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s preference for disinterested family witnesses over the defendant’s interested relatives.",
    "The trial judge’s inference of collusion to conceal ownership was not supported by sufficient factual basis on appeal.",
    "The principle in Brown v Dunn was considered, but the plaintiffs were not deemed to have admitted the defendant’s version due to lack of cross-examination on key points."
