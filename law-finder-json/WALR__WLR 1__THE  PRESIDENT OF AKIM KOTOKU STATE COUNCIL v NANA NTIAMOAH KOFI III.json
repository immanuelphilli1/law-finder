  "caseTitle": "THE PRESIDENT OF AKIM KOTOKU STATE COUNCIL v NANA NTIAMOAH KOFI III",
  "summary": "This 1955 West African Court of Appeal decision concerns an appeal by the President of the Akim Kotoku State Council against the reversal of a conviction of Nana Ntiamoah Kofi III, a former chief, for failing to surrender stool properties as required by a State Council order. The respondent was initially destooled in 1952 by the State Council for violating sacred customs, and ordered to surrender stool property. After non-compliance, he was convicted under Section 15(2) of the State Councils Ordinance. A second order in 1954, referencing a Supreme Court judgment, led to a second conviction, which was overturned on appeal on procedural grounds. The appellate court held that the 1954 order, though citing judicial decisions, was rooted in the Council’s original 1952 decision and was validly made under the Ordinance. The appeal was allowed, the conviction restored, and the lower court’s judgment set aside.",
