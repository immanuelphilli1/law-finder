  "caseTitle": "REX v MODUS WRAY",
  "summary": "In this 1941 West Africa Court of Appeal case, Modus Wray was originally convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment with hard labour. The appellate court found the sentence disproportionately severe given that the appellant was not a professional criminal and the act was characterized as a simple instance of violence. While recognizing the need for a deterrent sentence, the court quashed the original sentence and substituted a five-year imprisonment term with hard labour, effective from the date of conviction. The period during which the appellant was held as an unconvicted prisoner pending appeal was credited toward the new sentence, reflecting principles of fairness and proportionality in sentencing.",
