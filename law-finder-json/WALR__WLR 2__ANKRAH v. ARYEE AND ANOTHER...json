  "caseTitle": "ANKRAH VERSUS ARYEE",
  "summary": "In this 1957 Supreme Court of the Gold Coast case, the plaintiff sued the first defendant for �530 outstanding under a credit-sale agreement for a lorry, and the second defendant as guarantor. The agreement allowed the plaintiff to seize the vehicle upon default. The court held that the seizure clause provided an alternative remedy at the vendor's option, not an exclusive one, allowing recovery of the unpaid balance. However, the second defendant was not liable as the term 'guarantor' followed by his signature lacked sufficient detail to constitute a valid guarantee under the Statute of Frauds, 1677, s. 4. The word 'guarantor' was deemed merely descriptive and too vague to impose legal liability without clearer terms. Judgment was entered for the plaintiff against the first defendant, but the claim against the second defendant was dismissed.",
