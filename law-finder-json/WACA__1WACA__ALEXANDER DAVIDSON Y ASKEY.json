  "caseTitle": "ALEXANDER DAVIDSON Y ASKEY",
  "summary": "This case involved a dispute over the validity of the Amaw Tributaries Concession Zone 1, a diamond mining lease granted in 1926 by Nana Sir Ofori Atta and Kofi Dakwa over land in Topiramang, Akyem Abuakwa, to Richard Raymont Came. The African Selection Trust Ltd., Came's former employer, opposed the issuance of a Certificate of Validity under the Concessions Ordinance, alleging that Came obtained the concession through improper means: (1) by breaching his employment contract and using confidential information, and (2) by procuring the grantors to violate a prior covenant giving the Trust first refusal on adjacent land. The lower court, per Michelin J., held that 'improper means' under s 12(3) of the Ordinance applied only to misconduct against the native grantors, not third parties, and that the prior covenant was void for infringing the rule against perpetuities. On appeal, the West African Court of Appeal unanimously affirmed. Deane CJ and Aitkin J. held that s 12(3) must be construed narrowly to acts against grantors, and that the English Court of Appeal’s prior judgment—finding Came breached his service contract but did not procure the covenant’s breach due to lack of notice—was binding. The Court emphasized that even if the covenant were breached, it would not invalidate the concession under local law. The Trust’s remedies were limited to damages in England, not invalidation of the concession. The decision underscores the jurisdictional limits of concession validity proceedings and the primacy of native grantors’ interests under colonial mining law.",
