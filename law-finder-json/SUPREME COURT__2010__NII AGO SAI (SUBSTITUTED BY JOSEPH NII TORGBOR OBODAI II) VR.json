  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision resolves a civil land dispute over Obgojo lands in Accra, determining whether allodial title belongs to the Labadi Stool or to the Anahor and Dzirase families. The appellant, Nii Ago Sai (substituted by Joseph Nii Torgbor Obodai II), claimed title through settlement and demonstrated continuous acts of ownership, including granting leases to third parties—such as Top Construction Co. Ltd.—which were formally registered (Exhibits 1A, 2A, 3A). The respondent, Nii Kpobi Tettey Tsuru III, asserted title by conquest on behalf of the Labadi Stool, relying on historical tradition dating to 1690 and precedents like Owusu v. Manche of Labadi. However, the Court found that while the Labadi Stool holds allodial title over certain lands by conquest, it had acquiesced in the appellant’s family’s open and uninterrupted exercise of ownership, including alienation to non-stool members, thereby losing its claim through estoppel and operation of section 10(1) and 10(6) of the Limitation Decree 1972 (NRCD 54). The Court emphasized that mere long-term occupation is not proof of ownership unless accompanied by adverse acts inconsistent with the stool’s title. Given the appellant’s documented grants, physical development, and corroboration from independent witnesses—including the chief of Ashalley Botwe—the Court concluded that the Anahor and Dzirase families held allodial title. The appeal was allowed, restoring the trial court’s judgment in favor of the appellant.",
