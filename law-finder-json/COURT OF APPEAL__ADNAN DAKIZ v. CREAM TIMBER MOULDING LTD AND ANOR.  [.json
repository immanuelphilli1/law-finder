  "caseTitle": "DAKIZ v. CREAM TIMBER MOULDING LTD AND ANOR.",
  "summary": "This appeal arose from a ruling by the High Court, Sekondi, which granted a motion by the defendants to correct the interest amount stated in the Entry of Judgment following a consent judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The plaintiff, a former employee, had obtained a consent judgment for $15,000 and interest, plus costs, after the defendants failed to honor a 1996 agreement to settle unpaid entitlements. The defendants later challenged the interest calculation, claiming overstatement, and succeeded in having the High Court rule that the debt was fully paid. The Court of Appeal considered whether the High Court had jurisdiction to correct the judgment entry post-consent judgment. It held that while courts have inherent power and authority under Order 28 Rule 11 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules to correct clerical mistakes or accidental omissions, they cannot vary the terms of a consent judgment, which requires a fresh action if based on fraud or mistake. The appellate court found that the correction went beyond clerical error and effectively varied the judgment, which was impermissible. Thus, the appeal was allowed, and the High Court’s ruling set aside.",
