  "summary": "This case concerns a dispute over the validity of a land sale conducted in execution of a judgment after the judgment-debtor's death. The first defendant obtained a consent judgment against Chief Kwesi Odatsia in 1951. After Odatsia's death in 1952, the plaintiff succeeded him. The first defendant proceeded to issue a writ of fi. fa. without obtaining court leave or substituting the deceased with his successor. The properties were sold to the second defendant, who received certificates of purchase. The plaintiff challenged the sale's validity in the Native Court, arguing it was void due to procedural defects. The appeal centered on whether the failure to obtain leave and effect substitution was a mere irregularity or a jurisdictional nullity. The court held that execution could only issue against the estate or legal representative of a deceased judgment-debtor and only with court leave. Absent these, the court acted without jurisdiction, rendering the execution, sale, and certificates of purchase nullities. The decision in In re Shephard was followed, affirming that jurisdictional defects cannot be cured by lapse of time or acquiescence.",
