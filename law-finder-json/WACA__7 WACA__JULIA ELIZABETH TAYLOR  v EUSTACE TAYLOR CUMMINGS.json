  "caseTitle": "IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF JAMES TAYLOR, DECEASED",
  "summary": "This West Africa Court of Appeal case from 1941 concerned the construction of Clause 4 of James Taylor's will, which devised 'Tinubu House' to Emma Tinubu Taylor Cummings 'for the term of her natural life' but included a contingency: if she died before age 21 or marriage, the property would go to the executors to rent or sell, with proceeds forming part of the testator's personal estate. Emma died in 1937, over 21 and unmarried, having never married or disposed of the property. The trial court held the life estate language should be rejected and the property should revert to the residue of James Taylor's estate. The appellate court agreed the 'term of her natural life' was repugnant and thus invalid, confirming the devise was in fee simple. However, it disagreed with the trial court’s interpretation of the contingency, holding that the condition failed upon Emma attaining age 21, making the fee simple indefeasible. Therefore, the property formed part of Emma’s estate upon her death and passed to her administrator, the defendant. The appeal was allowed, the lower court’s judgment set aside, and costs awarded against the plaintiff.",
