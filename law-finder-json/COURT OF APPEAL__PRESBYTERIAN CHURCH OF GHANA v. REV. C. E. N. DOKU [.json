  "caseTitle": "PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH OF GHANA v. REV. C. E. N. DOKU",
  "summary": "The Presbyterian Church of Ghana appealed a High Court decision ordering the retired Reverend C. E. N. Doku to vacate the church manse and awarding him �5,000,000 in compensation for lost salary and �162,000 wrongly deducted from his entitlements. The Court of Appeal held that while the respondent was not estopped from challenging the propriety of his premature retirement—having been denied a hearing contrary to church regulations—the award of �5,000,000 for 17 years’ salary was excessive and unsupported by precedent. Relying on established case law, the court substituted the award with two years’ salary as damages. The court upheld the finding that the deduction of �162,000 was unjustified due to the church’s failure to provide a basis, and further ruled that interest should be awarded on that sum at the prevailing bank rate from the date of deduction to the date of judgment.",
