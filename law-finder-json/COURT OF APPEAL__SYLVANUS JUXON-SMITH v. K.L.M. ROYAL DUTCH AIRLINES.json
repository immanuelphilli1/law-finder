  "caseTitle": "SYLVANUS JUXON-SMITH v. K.L.M. ROYAL DUTCH AIRLINES",
  "summary": "In this civil appeal from the Accra Fast Track High Court, Sylvanus Juxon-Smith sued K.L.M. Royal Dutch Airlines for being denied boarding despite holding a valid business class ticket, claiming $600,000 in damages for losing a lucrative contract in Brussels. The Court of Appeal upheld the finding of deliberate denial of carriage but set aside the damages award. It held that while the airline breached its contract, the claimed loss was too remote as there was no evidence that a trip to Brussels was in the contemplation of the parties when the ticket was purchased. The court excluded Exhibits A–E and G for failing to comply with Section 161 of the Evidence Decree regarding authentication of foreign official documents. Exhibit F, a magazine issue, was properly admitted. The plaintiff failed to provide credible evidence of a submitted bid or efforts to notify Brussels authorities, rendering the damages unprovable and excessive.",
