  "caseTitle": "GERTRUDE AGYEKUM & AMADU BABA v. AMADU BABA & ALHAJI ABUBAK",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana ruling addressed an application by Gertrude Agyekum and Amadu Baba to amend their statement of case in a review application filed in 1998, over three years after the original motion and affidavit. The applicants sought to correct an omission regarding the statutory basis under section 93(2) of the Administration of Estates Act, 1961 (Act 63), arguing the original judgment was given per incuriam. The respondents objected on grounds that the statement of case was incompetent due to late filing and that Supreme Court rules do not permit amendment of such documents without express provision. The court held that non-compliance with Rule 56(1) of C.I. 16 rendered the application incompetent and that no waiver had been requested. It emphasized that review jurisdiction is exceptional, not a substitute for appeal, and must be based on fundamental error causing a gross miscarriage of justice. The court found the applicants' allegations insufficient and noted a prior binding judgment on the same property sale. Given the prolonged litigation—spanning over two decades—the court refused the amendment and struck out the review application, affirming the finality of judgments and the importance of procedural compliance.",
