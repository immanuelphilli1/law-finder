  "caseTitle": "CARROLL VERSUS ANDREWS AND OTHERS.",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of the Colony of the Gambia held that the Bathurst Reform Club, an unincorporated members' club, held the premises on a monthly tenancy after the expiration of a two-year lease, as the rent was expressed as \u000210 per month rather than an annual sum, thereby rebutting the presumption of a yearly tenancy. The court upheld the validity of the notice to quit given by the landlord. However, the action failed because the individual officers (secretary, president, treasurer) were not proper defendants, as an unincorporated club cannot be sued through its officers without a court order under R.S.C. (Gambia), Ord. 3, r. 3 authorizing representative parties. The claim was dismissed, but no costs were awarded due to initial pleading deficiencies.",
