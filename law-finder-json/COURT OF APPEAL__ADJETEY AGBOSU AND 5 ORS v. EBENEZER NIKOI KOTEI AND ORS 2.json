  "summary": "In Adjetey Agbosu and 5 Others v. Ebenezer Nikoi Kotey and Others (CA 212/2002 & 218/2002), the Court of Appeal of Ghana dismissed consolidated motions for stay of execution and interim preservation of property. The applicants, plaintiffs in a land dispute, sought to halt execution of a judgment and preserve land pending appeal, alleging the respondent’s family had improperly registered a Statutory Declaration (761/1977) over disputed land. The Court found the applications misconceived because, after allowing the appeal, it had issued no executable order in favor of the respondent. The trial court had dismissed the trespass claim due to lack of evidence, and the appellants failed to prove capacity to sue or clearly identify the boundaries of the land claimed. The Court emphasized that without a showing of prior wrongdoing or a judgment at risk of being undermined, interim relief could not be granted. It also clarified that under Act 122, the Lands Commission is obligated to register submitted documents, and such registration binds only the declarant. The applications were dismissed.",
