  "caseTitle": "EDMUND ASANTE – APPIAH v MADAM KATE AMPONSAH ALIAS YAA MANSA",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision from 2008 concerns a property dispute between Edmund Asante-Appiah (appellant) and Madam Kate Amponsah (respondent), who was the wife of the appellant's late half-brother. The appellant claimed sole ownership of a house and plot in Apedwa, purchased from the United African Company (UAC), and allowed his brother’s family to reside there. After the brother’s death, the respondent contested the claim, asserting joint purchase. The High Court initially ruled for the appellant, but the Court of Appeal reversed the decision. The Supreme Court upheld the reversal, primarily due to the invalidity of the power of attorney used by the appellant, who was resident in England. The power of attorney lacked a witness signature as required by Section 1(2) of the Power of Attorney Act, 1998 (Act 548), rendering it invalid. Consequently, the agent lacked capacity to litigate or testify, reducing the appellant’s case to mere pleadings. Additionally, the appellant failed to provide documentary evidence of purchase, violating the Conveyancing Act, 1975 (NRCD 175), which requires written evidence for land transactions. The Court affirmed that the burden of proof rested on the appellant to prove title, which he failed to do, and dismissed the appeal.",
