  "caseTitle": "YAW NSOWAH v. OKYEAME KOBIRI & B. OFORI BOATENG",
  "summary": "The Court of Appeal of Ghana set aside the High Court's judgment in favor of the plaintiff, Nana Yaw Nsowah, who had been awarded damages for trespass and unlawful closure of his beer bar. The appellate court held that the tenancy agreement (Exhibit A), upon which the plaintiff relied, was unenforceable because the plaintiff failed to prove that its contents were read and explained to the illiterate predecessor of the 1st defendant, as required by the Illiterate Protection Ordinance CAP 262. Consequently, the relationship was governed by the Rent Act, 1963 (Act 220). The court found that the 1st defendant had a legitimate counter-claim for recovery of possession due to non-payment of rent from April 1995, especially since rent increases had been mutually agreed upon. The eviction, conducted by a Rent Officer with official authority, did not constitute trespass. The trial judge was found to have erred in law by relying on the invalid agreement and dismissing the counter-claim. The appeal was allowed, and the plaintiff's claim dismissed.",
