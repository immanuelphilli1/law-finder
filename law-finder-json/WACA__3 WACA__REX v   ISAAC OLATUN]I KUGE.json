  "summary": "The appellant, Isaac Olatunji Kuge, was convicted on one count of stealing under section 390(6) and eleven counts of fraudulent false accounting under section 438(c) of the Criminal Code, and initially sentenced to the maximum penalty of seven years' imprisonment with hard labour on each count, to run concurrently. On appeal, the West African Court of Appeal acknowledged the seriousness of the offences, particularly in relation to the defrauding of native administrations, but found that in the absence of previous convictions and due to the case not being sufficiently flagrant, the maximum sentence was unjustified. Consequently, the appeal against sentence was allowed, the original sentences were quashed, and substituted with four years' imprisonment with hard labour on each count, to run concurrently.",
