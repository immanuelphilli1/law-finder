  "summary": "This 1957 West African Court of Appeal decision in Akofi v. Wiresi and Abagya concerned a dispute over customary land tenure systems on stool land in the Gold Coast (now Ghana). The plaintiff, representing a group of cocoa farmers, successfully claimed that their occupation of Odoben Stool land was under the 'abusa' system, entitling the stool to only one-third of farm produce, rather than the 'ebuenu' system, which would allow the stool to claim half the land. The Native Court and Land Court both found in favor of the abusa arrangement, noting its prevalence where tenants cleared virgin forest without landlord contribution. The appellate court upheld these concurrent findings, dismissing the defendants' appeal and affirming that representation under customary practice did not require formal written authorization.",
