  "caseTitle": "ROBERT OKPOTI KONEY",
  "summary": "This 1934 West Africa Court of Appeal decision in Robert Okpoti Koney v. Union Trading Co., Ltd. addressed the applicability of the Statute of Limitations in the Gold Coast (now Ghana). The plaintiff, an African carpenter, sued a European company for the return of a deposit after a defective sawing machine proved unusable. The court held that the claim was statute-barred, overturning the lower court's judgment. The central legal issue was whether English statutes of limitation applied given the mixed native and non-native status of the parties. The court interpreted Section 19 of the Supreme Court Ordinance to require that native customary law only apply where substantial injustice would result from its exclusion, particularly in cases between natives and non-natives. Since the plaintiff failed to show such injustice, English law applied, and the six-year limitation period began when the contract was breached in October 1924—well before the 1933 writ was issued.",
