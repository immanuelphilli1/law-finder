  "caseTitle": "REX v PETER NDBYEE",
  "summary": "In Rex v Peter NdbYee (WACA/7, 23rd April 1941), the appellant was convicted of manslaughter and, in the same trial, of a reckless and negligent act under section 343(c) of the Criminal Code, both based on the same facts. The West Africa Court of Appeal held that the charges should have been treated as alternatives, not cumulative. Consequently, the sentence on the second count was quashed, with no substitute sentence imposed, while the two-year sentence for manslaughter was upheld.",
