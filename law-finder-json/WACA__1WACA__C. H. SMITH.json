  "summary": "This 1932 West African Court of Appeal decision from Accra concerned a civil action by C. H. Smith against Societe Commerciale de l'Ouest Africain for unpaid commission on debt recoveries. The Circuit Court had dismissed the claim, deeming the commission agreements champertous and unenforceable. On appeal, the court reversed the decision, holding that the agreements did not constitute champerty or maintenance under English common law as applied in Ashanti. The judges emphasized that while English common law applied via the Supreme Court Ordinance, the absence of criminal liability under the Criminal Code did not render such contracts legally permissible. Crucially, the plaintiff acted as an authorized agent in debt recovery, with no officious intermeddling or risk to justice. The agreements were thus enforceable, and the appeal was allowed, with judgment entered for the plaintiff for £3 plus costs.",
