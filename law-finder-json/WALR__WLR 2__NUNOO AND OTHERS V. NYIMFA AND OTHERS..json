  "caseTitle": "AND OTHERS VERSUS NYIMFA",
  "summary": "In Nunoo and Others v. Nyimfa and Others, the appellants sought enforcement of a consent order made during a concession enquiry, which provided for the cancellation of an existing lease and the creation of a new one. The respondents refused to approve the draft new lease. The appellants applied to the Land Court to enforce the settlement under the Supreme Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1954, Order 42, Rule 23, or alternatively under section 19 of the Concessions Ordinance, c. 136 of 1951. The court dismissed the application, holding that once the lease was cancelled, no concession remained for enquiry, thus depriving the court of jurisdiction to enforce the settlement via interlocutory application. The West African Court of Appeal upheld this decision, ruling that the consent terms, though recorded, were not enforceable within the terminated proceeding and that enforcement required a separate substantive action. The court also held that section 19 of the Concessions Ordinance did not apply, as no concession had been declared invalid.",
