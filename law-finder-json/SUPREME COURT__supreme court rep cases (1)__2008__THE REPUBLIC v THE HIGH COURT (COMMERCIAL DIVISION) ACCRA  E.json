  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana ruling addresses whether the High Court (Commercial Division) had jurisdiction to hear a fresh action challenging an aspect of a consent judgment—specifically, the interest rate entered post-judgment. The Trust Bank Ltd., as applicant, sought certiorari to quash a lower court's decision allowing Ampomah Photo Lab Ltd. and others to file a new suit contesting the interest rate in a prior consent judgment. The Supreme Court held that a fresh action is the proper legal avenue to challenge a consent judgment, especially where appeal is unavailable. It affirmed that consent judgments, being based on agreement, can be set aside on grounds such as mistake, misrepresentation, or inequity, citing English and Ghanaian precedents. The Court declined to intervene via supervisory jurisdiction, finding no jurisdictional or fundamental error by the High Court. The ruling reaffirmed that supervisory powers under Article 132 of the 1992 Constitution apply only to manifest, fundamental errors, not ordinary legal disputes.",
