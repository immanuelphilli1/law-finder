  "caseTitle": "REX ANTNONY UCHE",
  "summary": "The appellant, Anthony Uche, was convicted on two counts of defiling a girl under the age of eleven and sentenced to five years' imprisonment with hard labour. The West African Court of Appeal allowed the appeal due to two fundamental errors by the trial judge. First, the judge failed to warn the jury about the need for caution when relying on the evidence of a child of tender years. Second, the judge misdirected the jury by stating there was medical evidence that both the accused and the girl had a gonorrhoeal discharge, when in fact the doctor only speculated about the nature of the discharge and had not conducted microscopic tests to confirm gonorrhoea in either party. The appellate court held that these errors could have led to a wrongful conviction and that a proper direction might have raised a reasonable doubt. Although there was some evidence supporting guilt, the appeal was allowed and the convictions quashed.",
