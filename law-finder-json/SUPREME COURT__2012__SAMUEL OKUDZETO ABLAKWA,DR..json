  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case involved a constitutional challenge by Dr. Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa and Dr. Edward Kofi Omane Boamah against the Attorney-General and Hon. Jake Otanka Obetsebi-Lamptey concerning the alleged unlawful sale of a government bungalow at St. Mungo Street, Ridge, Accra. The plaintiffs sought declarations that the Minister of Water Resources, Works and Housing in the Kufuor government lacked constitutional authority to direct the sale of public land, that such a sale violated Articles 20(5), 23, 257, 258, 265, 284, and 296 of the 1992 Constitution, and that the registration process initiated by the Lands Commission was unconstitutional. They also sought a perpetual injunction to halt registration. The court held that while issues of conflict of interest fall under CHRAJ’s jurisdiction under Article 287, the exercise of discretionary power in public land management is justiciable by the Supreme Court under its original jurisdiction. The court found that the sale lacked Cabinet approval, violated constitutional principles of fairness and due process under Article 296, and amounted to an abuse of power. The publication of the land registration notice was declared unconstitutional and void. The plaintiffs were found to have sufficient standing based on public interest. The claims of corruption and discrimination were dismissed for lack of evidence.",
