  "caseTitle": "AVUUGI v ABUGRI",
  "summary": "In Avuugi v Abugri, a Kusasi man sued another for seduction of his wife, claiming costs for a purification ceremony he performed and general damages. Both parties were subject to Kusasi customary law. The trial court awarded damages, which the appellate court upheld, citing precedents (Dapah v Madzigbe and Asante v Wiredu) to assert that damages for seduction are part of 'our customary law.' However, the decision was criticized for failing to properly ascertain Kusasi-specific customs, relying instead on non-Kusasi precedents. The case raised concerns about the 'Akanising' of customary law and the judiciary's duty to ascertain, rather than assume, the content of customary rules before application or modification. The court's approach blurred the line between applying existing custom and creating new law, undermining the requirement under the Courts Act for proper ascertainment when doubt exists.",
