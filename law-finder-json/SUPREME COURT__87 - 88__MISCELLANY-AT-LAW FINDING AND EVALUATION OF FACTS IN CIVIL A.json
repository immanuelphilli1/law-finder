  "caseTitle": "MISCELLANY-AT-LAW FINDING AND EVALUATION OF FACTS IN CIVIL A",
  "summary": "This Ghanaian legal commentary emphasizes the critical role of trial judges in making explicit and proper findings of primary facts in civil actions, which form the foundation for correct application of law. The trial judge, acting as both fact-finder and legal arbiter, must resolve conflicting evidence, assess witness credibility using statutory criteria (including demeanour, consistency, bias, and opportunity to observe), and avoid reliance on subjective impressions alone. The article cites key cases such as Quaye v Mariamu and Reindorf v Amadu to illustrate that appellate courts will not lightly overturn factual findings, particularly when based on observed witness demeanour, but may intervene where findings lack evidentiary support or overlook material contradictions. It stresses that findings must be sufficiently detailed to resolve all material issues, especially in land and traditional evidence cases, and that evaluation of established facts should be a logical, objective process. The commentary warns against overreliance on demeanour, citing examples of credible but false testimony, and underscores the importance of documentary and physical evidence in correcting erroneous factual conclusions.",
