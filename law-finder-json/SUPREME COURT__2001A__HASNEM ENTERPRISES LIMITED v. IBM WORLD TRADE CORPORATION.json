  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana judgment in Hasnem Enterprises Limited v. IBM World Trade Corporation (Civil Appeal No. 2/98, 16th May 2001) arose from a dispute over maintenance services for an IBM copier machine purchased in 1977. The respondent claimed specific performance of an alleged oral after-sales service agreement and damages for losses incurred when the appellant refused further servicing after 1984. While the trial court found no enforceable contract, the Court of Appeal reversed by majority. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld the appellant's appeal. A key issue was the period over which interest should accrue on a counterclaim for maintenance services. The trial court had awarded interest only up to judgment date (16th May 1990), but the Supreme Court held that interest must run until final payment due to Ghana's high inflation, citing the principle that a wrongfully withholding party should not benefit from use of another's money. Relying on LI 1295 and Section 2(4) of the Courts Act, 1993, the Court ordered interest at the current bank rate (linked to 90-day Treasury Bill rate of 45%) on the outstanding amount until full payment, emphasizing that creditors must be fully compensated for the time value of money and that courts should discourage debtors from using litigation to delay payment.",
