  "caseTitle": "SYLVIA GREGORY",
  "summary": "In this Ghanaian civil appeal, Sylvia Gregory, an African American woman, claimed ownership interest in a house at H/No. AV.31/3, Ankaful, Cape Coast, constructed on land owned by Nana Kwesi Tandoh IV and Bridget Hanson, a married couple. Gregory contributed financially to the construction and cohabited with the defendants, believing she had an ownership stake, especially after the first defendant allegedly proposed marriage. When relations soured, she sued for conveyance of the land, injunction, and equitable relief. The High Court upheld the defendants' ownership, granted their counterclaim for recovery of possession, but ordered assessment of Gregory's financial contribution for reimbursement. The Court of Appeal affirmed, finding her contribution insignificant and no valid marriage or trust. The Supreme Court dismissed her appeal, holding that the statutory declaration acknowledging her contribution was wrongly excluded but did not warrant overturning the factual findings, and that equitable doctrines like estoppel and resulting trust did not apply. The verdict emphasized that land ownership prevails absent clear legal or equitable title.",
