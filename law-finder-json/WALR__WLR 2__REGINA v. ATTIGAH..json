  "caseTitle": "REGINA VERSUS ATTIGAH.",
  "summary": "In Regina v. Attigah, the appellant, a police inspector with 24 years of service and a record of commendations, was convicted of extortion by a trial judge sitting with assessors. The prosecution's case relied on two witnesses who alleged that the appellant, through an accomplice, extorted money by threatening false prosecution. The trial judge dismissed the appellant's evidence of good character as immaterial before verdict, calling it 'sentiment.' The West African Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, holding that good character is always a material consideration, particularly where there is doubt about guilt. The court found that the evidence was not free from doubt—highlighting the lack of corroboration, the possibility of a conspiracy, and the implausibility of the witnesses' conduct. Given that one assessor had entertained doubt, the exclusion of good character evidence deprived the appellant of a fair chance at acquittal. The court set aside the conviction, entered a verdict of not guilty, and ordered the appellant's immediate discharge.",
