  "caseTitle": "REX v JAMES ANUKU",
  "summary": "In this 1940 West Africa Court of Appeal decision, James Anuku appealed his conviction for murder, arguing that the trial judge erred in rejecting the defense of insanity. The trial judge acknowledged that Anuku was not mentally normal but held that the evidence was insufficiently explicit to establish legal insanity under section 28 of the Criminal Code. The appellate court upheld the conviction, citing R. v. True, 16 C.A.R. 167, and affirmed that the judge, as the trier of fact, was entitled to conclude that the totality of the evidence did not prove insanity at the time of the offense. The appeal was dismissed.",
