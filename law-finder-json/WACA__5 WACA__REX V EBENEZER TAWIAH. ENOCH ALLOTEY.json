  "summary": "This 1939 West Africa Court of Appeal decision in Ghana addressed the appeals of 31 individuals, members of the Territorial Force band, convicted of stealing under section 271(2) of the Criminal Code following looting incidents during their return from Cape Coast to Accra. The charges arose from events at two villages, with three counts filed. The court quashed the convictions of 15 appellants on count 2 due to their names being omitted from the information, constituting improper arraignment. It also allowed the appeals of Joseph Lamptey and Nathaniel Lartey Mingle, finding a misdirection by the trial judge who incorrectly stated that no represented accused gave evidence, potentially prejudicing the jury's assessment of their testimony. The court upheld the principle of joint liability under section 46 of the Criminal Code, affirming that all could be convicted as principals if the looting was pursuant to a common agreement. It rejected arguments of misjoinder, holding the offences were part of the same transaction under sections 103 and 104 of the Criminal Procedure Code. While affirming the remaining convictions based on sufficient circumstantial evidence and possession of stolen goods, the court reduced all sentences from imprisonment to fines, considering the appellants' youth, military status, and the celebratory context.",
