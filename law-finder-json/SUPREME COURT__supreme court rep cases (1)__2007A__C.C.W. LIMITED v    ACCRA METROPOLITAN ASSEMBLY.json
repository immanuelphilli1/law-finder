  "caseTitle": "C.C.W. LIMITED v ACCRA METROPOLITAN ASSEMBLY",
  "summary": "In C.C.W. Limited v Accra Metropolitan Assembly, the Supreme Court of Ghana considered the validity and termination of a 1997 service agreement for waste management services. The Plaintiff, C.C.W. Limited, claimed breach of contract after the Defendant, Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA), terminated the agreement in 2001. The High Court found the contract was not signed under duress but was executed in violation of statutory procurement procedures under the Local Government Act, 1993 (Act 462), including failure to involve the District Tender Board and obtain required approvals. The Supreme Court upheld that non-compliance with mandatory statutory provisions rendered the agreement unenforceable, despite absence of duress. It held that public bodies cannot rely on their own procedural breaches to escape contractual obligations unless such breaches go to illegality. However, the Court affirmed termination due to failure to meet condition precedent—execution of a financing agreement with parliamentary approval under the Loans Act, 1970 (Act 335). The Plaintiff’s claims for payment and damages were dismissed, while AMA’s counterclaim for declarations of illegality was allowed in part.",
