  "caseTitle": "IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION OF NANA OSEI WORAE TO HAVE HIS NAME ON THE REGISTER OF CHIEFS OF THE NATIONAL HOUSE OF CHIEFS AND IN THE MATTER OF AN APPLICATION FOR THE ATTACHMENT AND OR COMMITTAL FOR CONTEMPT AND",
  "summary": "This is a ruling by the Supreme Court of Ghana on an application for review of its earlier decision dismissing a contempt motion. The applicant, Nana Adu Ameyaw II, sought to have 16 respondents, including chiefs and officials of the National House of Chiefs, attached for contempt, alleging they interfered with judicial processes concerning chieftaincy disputes. The Court dismissed the review application, holding that the original decision did not result in a miscarriage of justice. It reaffirmed that review under Rule 54 of the Supreme Court Rules is limited to exceptional circumstances involving fundamental errors or newly discovered evidence. The Court found no such error, noting that the majority had properly applied the law on contempt, which requires willfulness and jurisdictional competence. It emphasized that inferior tribunals like the National House of Chiefs cannot be held in contempt by the Supreme Court directly, and that the proper remedy for alleged violations of court orders lies in the High Court. The applicant’s reliance on constitutional provisions was deemed irrelevant to the jurisdictional issue. The ruling underscores the finality of judicial decisions and the narrow scope of review.",
