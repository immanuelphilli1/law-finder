  "caseTitle": "IN THE MATTER OF THE ESTATE OF JOHN ST",
  "summary": "This 1954 Privy Council decision concerns the distribution of the intestate estate of John St. Matthew Daniel, a Nigerian domiciliary whose parents were married under the Lagos Marriage Ordinance of 1884. The appellant, Matthew Olajide Bamgbose, claimed as the deceased's nephew through a line legitimated by the 1929 Legitimacy Ordinance. The respondents, children of the deceased's polygamous customary marriages, claimed inheritance rights. The central issue was the interpretation of Section 41 of the 1884 Marriage Ordinance, which mandates that estates of persons issue to marriages under the Ordinance be distributed according to English intestacy law, displacing native law. The Privy Council held that legitimacy is determined by the law of the domicile of origin, and that children of polygamous customary marriages, if legitimate under native law, are entitled to succeed under the English Statute of Distribution, 1670, as applied by the Ordinance. The appeal was dismissed, affirming the West African Court of Appeal's remittal for proof of the respondents' legitimacy and parentage.",

    "The West African Court of Appeal correctly remitted the case for proof of legitimacy and parentage under native law.",
    "No material difference exists between the 1884 and 1914 Marriage Ordinances for this case.",
    "The Privy Council declined to rule on the appellant’s own legitimacy, deeming it unnecessary."
