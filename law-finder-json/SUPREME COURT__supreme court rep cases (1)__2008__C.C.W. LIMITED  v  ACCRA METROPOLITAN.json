  "caseTitle": "C.C.W. LIMITED v ACCRA METROPOLITAN",
  "summary": "In C.C.W. Limited v Accra Metropolitan Assembly, the Supreme Court of Ghana considered the validity and termination of a 1997 service agreement for waste management services in Accra. The plaintiff, C.C.W. Limited, claimed breach of contract after the defendant unilaterally terminated the agreement in 2001. The defendant argued the contract was void due to non-compliance with statutory procurement procedures under the Local Government Act 1993 (Act 462), lack of parliamentary approval for financing, and alleged duress. The trial court found no duress but held the contract was improperly executed without adherence to tender board requirements and public procurement regulations. The Supreme Court upheld that non-compliance with statutory procedures rendered the agreement unenforceable, despite partial performance. It emphasized that public bodies must follow legal frameworks in contract execution to uphold transparency and accountability. The plaintiff's claims for payment and damages were dismissed, while the defendant’s counterclaim asserting illegality was sustained.",
