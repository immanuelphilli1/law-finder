  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana, in Republic v Edward Acquaye @ Nana Abor Yamoah II, addressed a contempt case arising from a chieftaincy dispute. The High Court had found Acquaye guilty of contempt for acting as chief of Gomoa Fetteh contrary to a 2001 order to maintain the status quo. The Court of Appeal reversed this, interpreting 'status quo' as preserving the state of affairs where Acquaye had been installed and gazetted as chief after the destoolment of his predecessor. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision, emphasizing that the superior courts lack jurisdiction over chieftaincy matters as courts of first instance and that the appeal was improperly framed. The Court rejected the appellants' attempt to broaden the scope of the appeal, reaffirming that contempt must be proven beyond reasonable doubt and that the original chieftaincy dispute should be resolved by the appropriate traditional council.",
