  "caseTitle": "REX v JOB KOJO FREMPAH",
  "summary": "Job Kojo Fremfah, the appellant, was charged with murder after killing Kwame Bandahene, a member of the public assisting a police constable in making a warrantless arrest for an alleged rape. The appellant had fled after being charged before a chief, who reported the matter to the police. During the arrest attempt, the appellant used a cutlass to kill Bandahene. At trial, the judge directed the assessors on the legal standards for self-defence and excessive force. The assessors unanimously found the appellant guilty of murder, a verdict supported by the trial judge's finding that the deceased did not attack or use unnecessary force. The West African Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, finding no reason to overturn the factual conclusions and affirming that the killing during resistance to a lawful arrest constituted murder.",
