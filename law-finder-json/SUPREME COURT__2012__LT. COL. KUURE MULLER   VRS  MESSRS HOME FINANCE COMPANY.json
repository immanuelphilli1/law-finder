  "caseTitle": "LT. COL. KUURE MULLER VRS MESSRS HOME FINANCE COMPANY",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case, decided on 14th November 2012, involved a dispute between Lt. Col. Kuure Muller (Plaintiff) and Home Finance Company (Defendant) over the failed delivery of a five-bedroom house purchased at a public auction in 2002 for $40,000 USD. The Plaintiff successfully bid for the property, but was later prevented from occupying it due to a successful legal claim by the original owner, Cyril Kofi Hayford. The High Court awarded the Plaintiff the current market value of the house to restore him to his original position, applying the principle of *restitutio in integrum*. However, the Court of Appeal reversed this, ordering only a refund of the purchase price with interest. The Supreme Court ultimately held that the Plaintiff, as an innocent purchaser for value without notice, was entitled to the current market value of the house to be restored to the position he would have been in had the contract been fulfilled, emphasizing that a mere refund with interest would not suffice given inflation and market changes over eight years.",
