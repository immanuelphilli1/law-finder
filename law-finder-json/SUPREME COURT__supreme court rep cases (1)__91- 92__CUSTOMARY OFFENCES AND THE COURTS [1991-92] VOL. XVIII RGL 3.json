  "summary": "This legal commentary by Acquah G. K. examines the jurisdiction and role of Ghanaian courts in enforcing or recognizing customary offences. It traces the historical development from pre-colonial indigenous justice systems, where chiefs held judicial power over customary matters, through colonial-era legislation such as the Bond of 1844, the Supreme Court Ordinance of 1876, and various Native Court Ordinances. The paper highlights that while native courts retained authority over certain customary offences, their powers were limited by statutory provisions and the repugnancy doctrine, which prohibits enforcement of customs contrary to natural justice, equity, and good conscience. Specific customary offences like invoking fetishes, adultery, disrespect to chiefs, and oath violations were triable in native courts, but only if prescribed by the Governor or not incompatible with statutory law. The author illustrates tensions between traditional authority and formal legal systems, emphasizing the courts' cautious approach to upholding customary sanctions.",
