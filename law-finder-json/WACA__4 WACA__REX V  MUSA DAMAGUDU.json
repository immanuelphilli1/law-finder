  "caseTitle": "REX V MUSA DAMAGUDU",
  "summary": "The West Africa Court of Appeal, sitting in Lagos on August 10, 1938, heard an appeal against conviction for murder under section 319 of the Criminal Code. The appellants, Musa and James Damagudu, challenged the trial court's decision on two grounds: improper identification procedure during a locus in quo visit and the finding being against the weight of evidence. The appellate court held that allowing an unsworn witness to identify a site during the visit was procedurally incorrect, as such persons should have been sworn, but found no substantial miscarriage of justice. On the second ground, the court affirmed that the conviction was supported by sufficient evidence. Both appeals were dismissed.",
