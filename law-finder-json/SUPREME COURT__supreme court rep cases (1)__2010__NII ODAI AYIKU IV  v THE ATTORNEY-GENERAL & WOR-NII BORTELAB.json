  "summary": "The case of Nii Odai Ayiku IV v The Attorney-General & Wor-Nii Bortelabi Borketey Laweh XIV involved a chieftaincy dispute concerning the validity of Executive Instrument E.I. 18 of 1983, which prohibited Nii Odai Ayiku IV from acting as Mantse of Nungua. The plaintiff, claiming to be the lawful chief enstooled in 1958, challenged the instrument on grounds that the factual basis for his destoolment in 1967 was false. A default judgment was entered in his favor by the High Court in 2001 when the Attorney-General failed to appear. However, the judgment was later set aside in 2005 by Asamoah J., who ruled that the High Court lacked jurisdiction over chieftaincy matters under Act 370 of 1971. The Court of Appeal upheld this decision in 2008, and the Supreme Court affirmed it, holding that the reliefs sought inherently involved a chieftaincy issue, thus falling outside the jurisdiction of the High Court. The court emphasized that any matter requiring evidence on enstoolment, destoolment, or succession is a chieftaincy cause, which must be adjudicated by a Chieftaincy Tribunal, not a regular court.",
