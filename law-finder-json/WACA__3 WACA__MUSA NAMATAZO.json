  "summary": "This civil case, Musa Namatazo v. E. W. Wright and G. H. Vivian, was heard by the West African Court of Appeal and concerned a claim for false imprisonment. The plaintiff alleged he was unlawfully detained in Minna from October 1934 to May 1935 by the first defendant, who threatened to arrest him if he left, in order to compel his appearance as a witness in an illegal mining prosecution. The trial court found that the plaintiff was indeed detained for about six months due to these threats, despite his testimony that he did not believe he would actually be arrested. The key legal question reserved for the appellate court was whether a threat to arrest, accompanied by a show of authority and resulting in submission, constitutes imprisonment under common law. Relying on the authoritative definition from Termes de la Ley, the appellate court affirmed that imprisonment includes any restraint on a person's liberty, whether in jail or otherwise. Since the trial judge had found that the plaintiff was detained by the defendant's actions, the appellate court upheld the decision, ruling that the threat and submission amounted to false imprisonment as a matter of law.",
