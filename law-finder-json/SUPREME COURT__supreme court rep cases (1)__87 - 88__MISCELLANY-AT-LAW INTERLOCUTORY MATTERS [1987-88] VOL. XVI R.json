  "caseTitle": "INTERLOCUTORY MATTERS VERSUS INTRODUCTION",
  "summary": "The document is a judicial lecture by Osei-Hwere P on interlocutory matters in civil procedure within the Ghanaian legal system. It emphasizes that interlocutory decisions—such as writ renewal, substituted service, and injunctions—involve judicial discretion that must be exercised judiciously, fairly, and with regard to broader social consequences. The speaker cautions against 'speaking orders' in interlocutory rulings to avoid appellate scrutiny and highlights that appellate courts may overturn discretionary decisions if made under legal error, factual misapprehension, or resulting in injustice. Specific examples include the refusal of an injunction in a football dispute to avoid public disruption, and a detailed discussion on writ renewal, referencing English case law (e.g., Firman v Ellis) and Ghana’s Limitation Decree, 1972 (NRCD 54), suggesting reform toward equitable discretion like England’s Limitation Act 1975, s 2D.",
