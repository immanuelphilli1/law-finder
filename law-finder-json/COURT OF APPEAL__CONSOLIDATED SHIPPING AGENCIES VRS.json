  "caseTitle": "CONSOLIDATED SHIPPING AGENCIES VRS",
  "summary": "In this civil appeal from a High Court judgment, Consolidated Shipping Agencies (Respondent) sued Satellite Trans Limited (Appellant) for damages after goods it contracted to transport from Tema Port to the Tema Free Zones enclave fell off the truck and were damaged. The High Court found the Appellant liable as a carrier for failing to transport the goods safely, awarding US$24,937.75 in special damages. The Appellant appealed, arguing it was a private carrier and not negligent, attributing the damage to improper loading by the Respondent's agent. The Court of Appeal upheld the decision, holding that the Appellant, as a bailee, owed a duty of care, and the damage during transit constituted prima facie evidence of negligence. The Appellant failed to rebut this, especially as its own driver confirmed the goods were properly loaded. The Court rejected the argument that road conditions or curves explained the incident, emphasizing the carrier's duty to exercise appropriate care. The Respondent's cross-appeal on interest was dismissed. The appeal was accordingly dismissed.",
