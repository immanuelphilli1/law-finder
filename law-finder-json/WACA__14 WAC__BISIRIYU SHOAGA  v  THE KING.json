  "caseTitle": "BISIRIYU SHOAGA v THE KING",
  "summary": "The appellant, Bisiriyu Shoaga, was convicted in the Supreme Court on two counts: breaking into a building and stealing a tyre, and stealing multiple motor car tyres. On appeal to the West African Court of Appeal, questions of witness credibility were not interfered with, as the trial judge had properly assessed demeanor and reliability. The court raised two procedural points: first, whether the appellant's name was properly added to the charge after the prosecution's case, and second, whether the trial judge erred in not inviting counsel to recall witnesses. Relying on Section 165 of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance, the court held that while an accused must be allowed to recall or cross-examine witnesses when a charge is amended, there is no duty to inform defense counsel of this right if the accused is legally represented, as counsel is presumed to know the law. The court found no prejudice and upheld the conviction. The second count was also upheld based on sufficient factual findings, particularly the trial judge's acceptance of co-accused Gamba’s evidence implicating the appellant. The appeal was dismissed.",
