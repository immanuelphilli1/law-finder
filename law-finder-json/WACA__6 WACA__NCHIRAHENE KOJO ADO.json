  "caseTitle": "Kodwo Nkoom v. Kwamin Etsiaku",
  "summary": "This 1940 West African Court of Appeal decision in Kumasi involved a claim by Nchirahene Kojo Ado, the plaintiff-respondent, to assert ultimate ownership of land occupied for 200 years by Buoyemhene Kojo Wusu, the defendant-appellant. The court reaffirmed the test from Kodwo Nkoom v. Kwamin Etsiaku (1922) F.C. 22, holding that expenditure on land improvements or litigation does not estop the true owner from asserting title unless such expenses were incurred under a genuine belief of ownership. The court found insufficient evidence that the defendant believed he was the owner or that his expenditures—such as building a motor road or litigating—were made on that basis. Native customary law was clear that ultimate ownership remained with the original owner, and the defendant could not rely on equitable estoppel under English law to defeat that right. The appeal was dismissed with costs.",
