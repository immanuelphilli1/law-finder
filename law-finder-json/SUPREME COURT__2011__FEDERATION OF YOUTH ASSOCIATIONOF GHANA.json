  "caseTitle": "FEDERATION OF YOUTH ASSOCIATIONOF GHANA",
  "summary": "The Federation of Youth Associations of Ghana (FEDYAG) brought an action before the Supreme Court of Ghana challenging the fee-paying policy of public universities as unconstitutional, arguing it violated the right to equal educational opportunities under Article 25 of the 1992 Constitution. The plaintiff contended that the policy allowed wealthier but less qualified students to gain admission over more qualified indigent applicants, thereby undermining constitutional guarantees. The defendants, including public universities and state education bodies, argued that the fee-paying policy did not diminish merit-based admissions and that revenues generated were reinvested to expand access and support scholarships. The Court held that Article 25(1) guarantees equal educational opportunities but is qualified by institutional capacity and the need for progressive realization. It found that the fee-paying policy, if implemented without reducing merit-based quotas and used to enhance educational access, does not contravene the Constitution. The judgment emphasized the state's obligation under Article 38 to provide educational facilities subject to available resources.",
