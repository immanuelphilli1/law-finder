  "caseTitle": "BOAKYE ETC. v. AUTO ROUTE AND ORS. AND E. O. BOAKYE v.",
  "summary": "The consolidated appeals arose from two High Court suits concerning ownership and development rights over Plot No. 86, Tema Motorway Industrial Area. The plaintiff, E.O. Boakye, claimed the plot was leased to him via Boakye and Company in 1977, but the Lands Commission re-leased it to Auto Route Limited in 1995 after alleging breach of development covenants. The trial court dismissed the plaintiff's claims, finding that the original lease was granted to Boakye and Darkwa Company, not Boakye and Company, thus the plaintiff lacked locus standi. The Court of Appeal upheld this, ruling that no valid amendment of lessee name occurred and that the Lands Commission lawfully re-entered the property under NRCD 175. The plaintiff’s appeal on grounds of improper re-entry notice and unlawful arrest was dismissed due to insufficient evidence and lack of standing.",
