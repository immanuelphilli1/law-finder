  "caseTitle": "KOKOR VERSUS FORFIE.",
  "summary": "This 1956 Ghanaian land appeal case, Kokor v. Forfie, centered on the jurisdictional validity of appellate proceedings in native courts within the Ashanti Confederacy. The dispute originated in the Ahafo Local Authority Court (a grade 'C' Native Court) and was appealed to the Kumasi Division Native Court (grade 'B'), then to the Asantehene's Court, and finally to the Land Court. The Supreme Court, per Benson J., held that the Kumasi Division Native Court lacked appellate jurisdiction in land matters because such jurisdiction was exclusively vested in the Asantehene's Court under section 25(2) of the Native Courts (Ashanti) Ordinance, c. 99 of 1951. The court ruled that the Chief Regional Officer's 1951 Order creating appellate powers for the Kumasi Division Native Court was ultra vires and invalid, as it conflicted with the Ordinance. Subsequent orders in 1953 attempting to validate or transition jurisdiction were also invalid. Consequently, all appellate proceedings before the Kumasi Division Native Court and the Asantehene's Court were declared nullities. The Land Court, having proper jurisdiction as the appellate body from the Asantehene's Court, could not remit the appeal under Rule 129(1) of the Native Courts (Ashanti) Procedure Rules since it had jurisdiction. The original judgment of the court of first instance—favoring the defendant—was restored, and the appeal was dismissed.",
