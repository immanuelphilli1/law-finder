  "caseTitle": "KUBI AND OTHERS v DALI",
  "summary": "In Kubi v Dali, a Ghanaian trader was awarded damages for personal injury and loss of earnings following a negligent accident. The Court of Appeal upheld the trial court's findings but identified a legal error: the failure to deduct income tax from awards for loss of actual and future earnings. Abban JA ruled that since the plaintiff would have paid tax on such earnings, damages should reflect net, not gross, income to prevent unjust enrichment. Citing British Transport Commission v Gourley, the court held that ignoring tax liability violates the principle of compensation by placing the plaintiff in a better financial position than if unharmed. Unable to calculate exact tax, the court estimated one-third of the total earnings award (�64,333) as payable to the Commissioner of Income Tax. This decision established a precedent in Ghanaian law requiring tax considerations in personal injury compensation.",
