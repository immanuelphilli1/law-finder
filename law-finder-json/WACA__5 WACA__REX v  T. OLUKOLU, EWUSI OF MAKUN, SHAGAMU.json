  "summary": "This 1939 West African Court of Appeal decision in Rex v. T. Olukolu, Ewusi of Makun, Shagamu, concerned an appeal against a conviction for judicial corruption under section 114(1) of the Criminal Code. The appellant was charged with both 'asking' and 'receiving' a bribe, but the trial judge convicted him only for 'corruptly asking' for a bribe, treating the two acts as distinct offences. The appellate court upheld the conviction, ruling that the act of 'asking' constituted a complete offence independent of receipt, and that the trial judge correctly separated the two elements in his reasoning. The court also held that a witness who acted as a government spy in exposing the bribery was not an accomplice requiring corroboration, as his involvement extended only to the actus reus, not the mens rea of the offence. The appeal was dismissed on all grounds, including claims of insufficient evidence, lack of corroboration, judicial misdirection, and alleged prosecutorial entrapment.",
