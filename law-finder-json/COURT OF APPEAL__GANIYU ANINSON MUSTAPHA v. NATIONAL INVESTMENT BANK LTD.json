  "summary": "This Court of Appeal decision from 29th May 2003 concerns an interlocutory appeal by Ganiyu Aninson Mustapha against the High Court's refusal to grant summary judgment in his claim against National Investment Bank Ltd for US$10,000 in alleged unpaid overseas per diem allowance. The Court dismissed the appeal, holding that the appellant failed to comply with Order 14 Rules 1 and 2 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, as he did not provide sufficient factual basis in his affidavit to demonstrate that the defendant had no defence. The Court emphasized that merely stating there is no defence is insufficient without supporting facts. Additionally, the appellant had previously filed a similar claim in 1997 (Suit No. C.753/97), which he unilaterally withdrew after a summons for directions, in violation of Order 26(2), which requires mutual written consent for withdrawal after trial preparation. As a result, the earlier suit remained pending, rendering the current action an abuse of court process.",
