  "caseTitle": "OJUOLAPE VERSUS BENNING",
  "summary": "In Ojuolape v. Benning, the Supreme Court of the Gold Coast set aside a sale of immovable property conducted without the required twenty-one days' public notice, following an indefinite postponement due to interpleader proceedings. Although initial notice had been given for a January 1956 sale, the sale was delayed for ten months. The registrar's telegram instructing the auctioneer to proceed did not trigger compliance with the notice rule, which the court held must be re-fulfilled after indefinite postponement. The court rejected reliance on Okai v. O. J. Reindorf, distinguishing it based on outdated rules. Finding a material irregularity under Order 51, Rule 15 of the Supreme Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 1954, the sale was invalidated. The property was ordered to be resold with proper notice, the purchaser was to be refunded from resale proceeds, and the auctioneer was ordered to pay the applicant's costs.",
