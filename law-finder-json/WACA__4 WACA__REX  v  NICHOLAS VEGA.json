  "caseTitle": "REX v NICHOLAS VEGA",
  "summary": "The appellant, a prison warder, was convicted of stealing old corrugated iron sheets belonging to the government. On appeal, the West Africa Court of Appeal quashed the conviction, holding that the appellant acted in good faith and reasonably believed the materials had been abandoned by the government. The court emphasized that abandoned property cannot be stolen, and thus there was no mens rea. Additionally, the trial judge misdirected himself by applying an incorrect legal test for theft under Section 383 of the Criminal Code and failed to consider the appellant's belief regarding abandonment, constituting a further misdirection.",
