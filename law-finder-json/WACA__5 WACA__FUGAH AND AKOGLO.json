  "caseTitle": "AWUMEE GBEDEMAH VERSUS AMAKLOE, CHIEF ATTIPOE",
  "summary": "This 1939 West African Court of Appeal decision in Fugah and Akoglo v. Amakloe, Chief Attipoe, addressed a motion for final leave to appeal to the Privy Council concerning the sufficiency of a bond executed by the appellants. The appellants were required to execute a bond binding on the Klevie Tribe, but instead executed it in their personal capacity without purporting to act as tribal representatives. The Court held that the bond was not binding on the tribe and refused permission to amend and re-execute it, as the respondent had no opportunity to assess the validity of the alleged authority from the tribe. The appellants had legal representation and were deemed responsible for failing to comply with the court's prior order. Final leave to appeal was therefore denied, and the respondent was awarded costs.",
