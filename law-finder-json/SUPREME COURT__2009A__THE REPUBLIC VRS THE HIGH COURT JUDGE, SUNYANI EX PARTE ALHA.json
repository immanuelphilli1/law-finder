  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC VRS THE HIGH COURT JUDGE, SUNYANI EX PARTE ALHA",
  "summary": "This 2009 Supreme Court of Ghana ruling addressed whether the High Court could entertain an election petition before the Electoral Commission declared and gazetted election results. The case arose when Alhaji Collins Dauda sought to quash a High Court judge's decision to hear a petition by Yiadom Boakye-Boateng challenging the parliamentary election in Asutifi South, alleging ballot box tampering. The Supreme Court unanimously held that the High Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the petition prior to the official declaration of results, emphasizing that even allegations of corrupt practices must await the formal declaration of an election outcome. The Court clarified that the phrase 'the person whose election is questioned' in Section 18(1) of PNDCL 284 implies a post-declaration context, rendering premature petitions invalid. It also criticized prior obiter dicta that suggested otherwise as per incuriam.",
