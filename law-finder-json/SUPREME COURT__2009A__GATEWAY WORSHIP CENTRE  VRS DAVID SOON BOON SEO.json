  "summary": "This is a civil appeal before the Supreme Court of Ghana concerning the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court to apply principles of equity and trusts in a land dispute. The appellant, a Korean missionary, raised funds in Korea allegedly for the respondent church (Gateway Worship Centre), used part of the funds to purchase land, but did not remit the money to the church. The church and its pastor sued for declaration of title, recovery of possession, and injunction. The Circuit Court and Court of Appeal ruled in favor of the church, holding the land was held in trust. The appellant challenged the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court to apply equitable principles. The Supreme Court held that under Article 11 of the 1992 Constitution and the Interpretation Act, all courts in Ghana are courts of both law and equity, and thus the Circuit Court had jurisdiction to apply trust principles in land matters. The appeal was dismissed, affirming that equitable remedies like constructive trusts are within the Circuit Court's jurisdiction when tied to land disputes.",
