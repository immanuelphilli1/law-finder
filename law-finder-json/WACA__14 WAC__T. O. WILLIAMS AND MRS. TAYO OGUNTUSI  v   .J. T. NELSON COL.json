  "summary": "In this West African Court of Appeal case, the appellants—children of the original mortgagor—sued the executors of P. H. Williams, who had taken possession of mortgaged property after a failed sale to a bank. The mortgagee's executors had auctioned the property to the bank for £750 but executed no conveyance, and the bank never took possession. After the bank's liquidation, its liquidators settled a claim against the mortgagee’s executors for £400. P. H. Williams, a director of the bank and executor, later claimed title and took possession. The court held that the sale to the bank was ineffective to extinguish the mortgagor's equity of redemption, as no conveyance occurred and possession was not transferred. The appeal was allowed, and judgment for possession was granted to the appellants as against Williams’ executors, though no declaration of title was issued since the mortgagee's estate was not a party. The court emphasized that the legal estate remained in the mortgagee’s estate and that Williams’ possession was unjustified.",
