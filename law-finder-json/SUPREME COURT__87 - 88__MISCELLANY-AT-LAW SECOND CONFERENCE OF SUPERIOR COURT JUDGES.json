  "caseTitle": "MISCELLANY-AT-LAW SECOND CONFERENCE OF SUPERIOR COURT JUDGES",
  "summary": "The Second Conference of Superior Court Judges in Ghana, held in July 1988, focused on the theme of 'Proof in Law' as part of a continuing judicial education programme. Chief Justice E.N.P. Sowah highlighted the success of the prior year's conference, particularly the creation of a self-regulatory Code of Ethics for Judges, which, though not statutory, was deemed essential for guiding judicial conduct and potentially serving as grounds for misconduct charges if violated. The Code aims to clarify appropriate judicial behavior both for judges and the public. The Chief Justice also addressed systemic delays in court record production, announcing efforts to mechanise recording systems to deliver transcripts within 24 hours, starting with key courts and seeking government support. On the theme of proof, he explained the dual burdens under the Evidence Decree (NRCD 323): burden of persuasion (s. 10(1)) and burden of producing evidence (s. 11(1)), emphasizing that the burden of proof determines outcomes when doubt remains. Papers presented by legal experts sparked debate on cross-examination, evidence-in-chief, and the distinction between objective evidence and subjective truth. The conference underscored the judiciary's commitment to professionalism, transparency, and efficiency.",
