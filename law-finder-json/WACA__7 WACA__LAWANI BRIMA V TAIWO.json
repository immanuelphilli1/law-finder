  "summary": "This 1941 West Africa Court of Appeal decision involved a dispute over customary land rights in Ghana. The defendants-appellants, descendants of a domestic servant of the plaintiffs-respondents' ancestor, had been granted customary permission to occupy family land. They later leased the property to a third party for thirty years without the plaintiffs' consent. The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the defendants had forfeited their customary rights due to misbehaviour. The defendants initially claimed fee simple ownership and raised defences of long possession, laches, and the Real Property Limitation Act 1874, but abandoned the title claim. The trial court and the appellate court held that leasing the land under a claim of ownership constituted a direct challenge to the overlord's rights, amounting to misbehaviour and resulting in forfeiture. The court emphasized that not every lease leads to forfeiture, but each case must be assessed on its facts. The appeal was dismissed with costs.",
