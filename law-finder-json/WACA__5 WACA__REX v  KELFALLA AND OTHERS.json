  "caseTitle": "REX v KELFALLA AND OTHERS",
  "summary": "In this 1939 West African Court of Appeal decision, five appellants convicted of the murder of an unknown man in Sierra Leone appealed on grounds of procedural error and insufficiency of evidence. The prosecution alleged a ritualistic cannibalistic murder orchestrated by Paramount Chief Jo Kwi, though he was not charged and testified for the Crown. The appellants, including sub-chiefs and servants of Jo Kwi, were convicted based partly on uncorroborated testimony. The appellate court held that prosecution witnesses who testified at the preliminary investigation must be made available for cross-examination at trial, and merely offering them to the defence is insufficient. Since three key witnesses (including Jo Kwi) were not called, and the defence denied cross-examination, the court exercised its discretion to call Jo Kwi during the appeal, whose testimony undermined the prosecution’s case. Additionally, the court found that the fifth appellant's conviction relied solely on the uncorroborated evidence of a witness (Siaffa Mada) whom the trial judge deemed an accomplice. As no corroboration existed, the conviction could not stand. The appeals of all appellants were allowed, convictions quashed, and acquittals entered.",
