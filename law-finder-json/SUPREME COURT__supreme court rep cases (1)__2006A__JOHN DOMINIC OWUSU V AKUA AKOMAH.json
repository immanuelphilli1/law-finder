  "caseTitle": "JOHN DOMINIC OWUSU V AKUA AKOMAH",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed the appeal in *John Dominic Owusu v Akua Akomah*, affirming the Court of Appeal's judgment that overturned the High Court's decision. The plaintiff had claimed ownership of property via a 1987 written deed of assignment, but the trial court found the deed was not executed by the defendant and was procured in fraud, rendering it null and void. The defendant alleged an oral agreement from 1986 requiring full payment within three months, which the plaintiff failed to meet. The Supreme Court held that no valid contract existed for specific performance, emphasizing that pleadings define the scope of adjudication and that the plaintiff’s reliance on a fraudulent document barred equitable relief under the 'clean hands' doctrine. It further ruled that time was of the essence due to high inflation, making delayed payment unacceptable. The appeal against costs was also dismissed.",
