  "caseTitle": "PEARSON EDUCATION LIMITED - - - DEFANDENT VRS MORGAN ADZEI - - -",
  "summary": "This 2011 Supreme Court of Ghana decision in Pearson Education Limited v. Morgan Adzei centered on a chieftaincy dispute over the rightful occupant of the Akona stool in Takoradi. The appellant, claiming through the Amoa Ekua royal line, initiated proceedings before the Ahanta Traditional Council seeking to nullify the respondent's nomination and installation. The Council initially ruled in favor of the appellant, declaring it was the turn of the Adwoa Amoanu line to succeed. However, on appeal, the Western Region House of Chiefs reversed this decision, which was later affirmed by the National House of Chiefs. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld the reversal, holding that the 1963 judgment in A.E. Quayson v. Kobina Benuyie had already conclusively determined the succession rights to the stool, involving privies of the current parties. The Court found the Ahanta Traditional Council's 2004 decision to be perverse and unreasonable as it contradicted the earlier binding judgment. The doctrine of res judicata and estoppel by judgment barred the relitigation of the same issue. Additionally, the Court rejected the appellant's argument that the respondent's representation was invalid, affirming the attorney's broad authority to represent both the individual and the stool. The appeal was dismissed, confirming the respondent's valid installation as Osahene Katakyi Busumakura III.",
