  "summary": "This 1939 West Africa Court of Appeal decision in Accra, Ghana, involved an appeal against a conviction for stealing by Armaah Quarshie. The court addressed the admissibility of two confessions: the first, made to a corporal without a caution and while the appellant believed he was under arrest, was deemed inadmissible. However, the second, a written statement (Exhibit 'D') given at the police charge office after proper cautioning, was upheld as voluntary and admissible, despite the prior uncautioned admission. The court found no coercion or inducement and noted the appellant's active cooperation, including implicating co-accused and leading police to stolen property. The visit to Labadi beach, where stolen items were found, was considered consistent with the appellant's conduct and did not prejudice the case unfairly. The appellant's trial explanation for his presence at the beach was deemed unconvincing. The court distinguished the present case from cited precedents and affirmed the conviction.",
