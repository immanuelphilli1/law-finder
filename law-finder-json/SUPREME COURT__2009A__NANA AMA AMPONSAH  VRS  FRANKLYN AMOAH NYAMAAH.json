  "summary": "This 2009 Supreme Court of Ghana judgment in Nana Ama Amponsah v. Franklyn Amoah Nyamaah concerns a matrimonial dispute involving dissolution of marriage, property division, and custody of children. The parties married under Akan Customary law in 1991 and had four children. The petitioner sought dissolution of marriage and partition of the matrimonial home at Plot 15 Block B, Odeneho Kwadaso, Kumasi. The High Court granted custody to the mother, denied alimony, and ruled the property not jointly owned, while erroneously adjudicating on an unrelated property at Atwima Afiasiebon. The Court of Appeal reversed, declaring the Odeneho Kwadaso house jointly owned and ordering partition, while recognizing the Afiasiebon property as belonging to the petitioner’s mother. The Supreme Court held that the lower courts lacked jurisdiction to rule on the Afiasiebon property since it was not claimed by either party, constituting an irregular exercise of jurisdiction. Regarding the Odeneho Kwadaso house, the Court found it was jointly enjoyed and treated as marital property, with allocation documents in the appellant’s name, and affirmed its status as matrimonial property subject to equitable sharing, overturning the appellant’s claim that it belonged solely to his father or to him alone.",
