  "summary": "The appellant, Momo Kamara, entered a railway station compound through a route marked 'No thoroughfare' to deliver food to his master, a railway employee. Upon entry, he became a trespasser, and after being instructed by a police constable to leave, he refused. The West Africa Court of Appeal upheld his conviction for trespass under section 39 of Cap. 180 of the Laws of Sierra Leone, affirming that entry via a prohibited route constitutes trespass regardless of intent, and dismissed the appeal.",
