  "summary": "In Regina v. Jagne and N'Jie, the first accused, Abdoulie Amadou Jagne, a public servant and accounting officer, was charged with stealing a gross sum of \u00023,230 14s. 0d. over several months, while the second accused, Ebrima N'Jie, was charged with aiding and abetting the theft and with a separate count of theft. The court held that under Section 158 of the Criminal Procedure Code, a charge of theft against a public servant may allege a general deficiency without specifying individual misappropriations, provided the aggregate sum and time frame are clear. The evidence showed Jagne maintained cash balances far exceeding his operational needs—reaching over \u000210,000—without justification, and failed to make daily cash statements or enter receipts promptly, indicating systematic misappropriation. The staged incident on May 1, 1956, where N'Jie was caught taking money from the safe, was found to be a fabrication to explain the deficiency. The court ruled that N'Jie could not be convicted as an abettor because his involvement occurred after the theft was complete, making him an accessory after the fact, a distinct offense requiring a separate charge under s.155, which was not laid. Thus, the charge of aiding and abetting failed. The judgment clarifies the limits of joint liability and the procedural validity of aggregate theft charges in public office cases.",
