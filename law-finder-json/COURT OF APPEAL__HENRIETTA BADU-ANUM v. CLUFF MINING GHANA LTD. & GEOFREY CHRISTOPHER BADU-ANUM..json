  "caseTitle": "HENRIETTA BADU-ANUM v. CLUFF MINING GHANA LTD. & GEOFREY",
  "summary": "This Court of Appeal case arose from a fatal road accident on the Accra-Mankessim road involving a Landrover (ACR 6201) driven by Geoffrey Christopher Badu-Anum and an articulated truck (WRA 3233). The plaintiff, Henrietta Badu-Anum, sued her husband for negligence and Cluff Mining Ghana Ltd. for vicarious liability, claiming the company owned the vehicle. The High Court had ruled in her favor, but the Court of Appeal reviewed the evidence. The police report (Exhibit B) alleged the second defendant was overtaking at high speed and lost control, causing a head-on collision. However, no witness statements corroborated the overtaking claim, and the plaintiff’s own evidence varied between a taxi and an unidentified vehicle. The second defendant claimed the truck strayed into his lane, forcing him to swerve. The court emphasized that a collision raises a rebuttable inference of negligence against both drivers. On vicarious liability, the first defendant proved it had transferred ownership of the vehicle to the second defendant’s company in 1991 for $7,500 and delivery of the vehicle, with documentation provided. As the company was no longer the registered owner, vicarious liability did not apply. The appeal was allowed, overturning the High Court’s judgment.",
