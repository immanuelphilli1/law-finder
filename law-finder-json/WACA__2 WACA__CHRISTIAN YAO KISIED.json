  "caseTitle": "CHRISTIAN YAO KISIED",
  "summary": "This Privy Council judgment from 1937 overturned a West African Court of Appeal decision in a land dispute between Christian Yao Kisiedu and Kwao Dompreh (represented by Djorbua Dompreh after death), which involved conflicting land grants from the Stools of Tafo and Asafo in Akyem Abuakwa, Gold Coast (now Ghana). The core issue was not individual trespass but the superior title to the 'green land' parcel. The trial judge, Deane C.J., found that the land originally belonged to the Stool of Tafo, based on oral tradition and crucially, the fact that in 1904, the Odikro of Adjapoma, when in debt, sought and received financial assistance from the Ohene of Tafo, indicating Tafo's overlordship. The Court of Appeal reversed this, doubting the extent of Kisiedu's purchase and the survey evidence. The Privy Council reinstated the trial judge's decision, holding that the appellate court erred in overturning factual findings based on oral testimony and conduct, especially when a solid, undisputed fact (the 1904 financial assistance) strongly supported Tafo's title. The judgment underscores the importance of deference to trial judges in assessing evidence in customary land disputes.",
