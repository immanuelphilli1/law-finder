  "caseTitle": "G B. AMANCIO SANTOS",
  "summary": "In this civil appeal before the West Africa Court of Appeal, the plaintiff-appellant, G. B. Amancio Santos, challenged the dismissal of his trespass action against Ikosi Industries Limited and the Epe Native Administration. The dispute centered on a strip of swamp land between a footpath and the lagoon at Aiyetoro, Epe, which the defendants used to build a pier. The trial judge dismissed the claim, holding that the land was communal beach land under native custom and that the prior judgment in Suit No. 392/28 did not constitute estoppel. The appellate court found a misdirection in law, noting that Henshaw v. Henshaw (concerning Calabar) was inapplicable to Epe, and that the prior litigation had already determined the land was not communal. The court also held that the issue of possession was overlooked and that the trial judge failed to rule on laches and damages. Consequently, a retrial was ordered to determine these outstanding issues.",

    "The appellate court found that the trial judge misdirected himself by applying Henshaw v. Henshaw, which concerned Calabar customs, to land in Epe, Nigeria.",
    "The land in dispute was not foreshore but a strip above high water mark, and thus not automatically communal under native law.",
    "The previous judgment in Suit No. 392/28 should have operated as estoppel since the same land and parties (or their privies) were involved.",
    "The trial court failed to assess laches and damages, necessitating a retrial."
