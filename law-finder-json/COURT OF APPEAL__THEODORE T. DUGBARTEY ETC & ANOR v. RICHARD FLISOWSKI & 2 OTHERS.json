  "summary": "This Court of Appeal decision in Ghana arose from a land dispute over a 20.6-acre parcel at Okwenya. The original plaintiff, Theodore T. Dugbartey, sought a declaration of title, damages for trespass, and a perpetual injunction against Richard Flisowski and others. The case expanded when co-plaintiff Samuel Degbor and co-defendant Tetteh Quarshie were joined to represent larger family land interests. However, procedural irregularities emerged: the writ was not amended within the mandatory 14-day period under Order 15 Rule 8 of LI 1129 to reflect the joinder, meaning the added parties were not technically valid participants. Despite this, the Court of Appeal granted a retroactive extension of time to comply, citing the principle of real justice and the absence of prejudice. The trial court had focused exclusively on the co-parties' broader claims, disregarding the original plaintiff's claims. The appellate court found this approach erroneous and emphasized that the case should be decided on its merits. Ultimately, the appeal was allowed in part to correct procedural defects and ensure a fair determination of all claims, particularly those concerning family land rights and title validity.",
