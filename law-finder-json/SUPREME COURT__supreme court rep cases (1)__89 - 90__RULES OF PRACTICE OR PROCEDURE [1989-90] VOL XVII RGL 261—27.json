  "caseTitle": "RULES OF PRACTICE OR PROCEDURE [1989-90] VOL XVII RGL 261—27",
  "summary": "The case examines the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Ghana under rule 66(1) of the Supreme Court Rules, 1970 (CI 13) to waive non-compliance with rule 13(1), which mandates appellants to file a statement of case within three weeks of notification that the record of appeal is ready. In Darke XII v Dei XI, the Supreme Court, by a majority, held that rule 66(1) grants the court jurisdiction to waive non-compliance with rule 13(1) and restore an appeal deemed struck out, interpreting 'action' to include appellate proceedings. However, on the same day, in In re Oppong (Decd), a differently constituted bench held contrarily that rule 66(1) applies only to original jurisdiction matters, thus denying jurisdiction to restore struck-out appeals. The conflicting decisions raise concerns about consistency, with criticism that In re Oppong (Decd) was decided per incuriam, failing to consider the earlier binding decision in Darke XII v Dei XI.",
