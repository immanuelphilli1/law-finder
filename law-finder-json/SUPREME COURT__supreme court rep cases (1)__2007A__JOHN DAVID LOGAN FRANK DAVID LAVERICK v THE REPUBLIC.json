  "caseTitle": "JOHN DAVID LOGAN FRANK DAVID LAVERICK v THE REPUBLIC",
  "summary": "The appellants, John David Logan and Frank David Laverick, both British nationals, were convicted by the trial court and the Court of Appeal for criminal conspiracy and unlawful possession of 588.33 kilograms of cocaine under Ghana's Narcotic Drugs (Control, Enforcement and Sanctions) Law, P.N.D.C.L. 236. The Supreme Court of Ghana, in its judgment, found that the prosecution failed to present any direct or circumstantial evidence linking the two appellants to the conspiracy or possession charges. Although they were present at the residence of the first accused during a police raid, mere presence without incriminating evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction. The Supreme Court held that the verdicts were unreasonable and not supported by the evidence, thereby quashing the convictions and setting aside the 20-year sentences. The court emphasized that convictions in conspiracy cases must be based on inferential evidence arising from coordinated criminal acts, which was absent here.",
