  "caseTitle": "CHIEF KWEKU SERBEH",
  "summary": "This case involved a civil boundary dispute between Chief Kwaku Serbeh (appellant) and Ohene Kobina Karikari (respondent) over tribal lands in Ghana. The Chief Commissioner had determined the boundary as a straight line between points A and B, based on evidence of an original agreement between predecessors. The Court of Appeal upheld this decision, deferring to the trial court's factual findings. The Privy Council dismissed the appeal, affirming that concurrent factual findings by lower courts should not be disturbed absent compelling reason. The appeal was dismissed with costs.",
