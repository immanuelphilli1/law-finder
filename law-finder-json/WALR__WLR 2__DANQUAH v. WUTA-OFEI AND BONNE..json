  "summary": "In Danquah v. Wuta-Ofei and Bonne (1956), the West African Court of Appeal addressed the legal effects of the Accra Town (Lands) Ordinance, c. 87 of 1951, on possessory rights following compulsory acquisition. The plaintiff received an oral grant of stool land in 1939, confirmed by a 1945 deed, and was in possession when the first defendant built on the land in 1948. The defendant argued that the plaintiff’s rights were extinguished under section 5(4) of the Ordinance for failure to claim compensation within the statutory period. The court held that 'deemed to have determined' under section 5(4) did not extinguish rights absolutely but only as against the Chief Secretary regarding compensation claims. The plaintiff, as a possessor, retained superior rights against all except the Crown and was entitled to recovery of possession, mesne profits, and an injunction, though not a declaration of title. The decision clarified that unclaimed interests could be restored upon divestment under section 2(2).",
