  "caseTitle": "KOWUS MOTORS v CHECK POINT GH. LTD. 7 ORS",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed the appeal filed by Kowus Motors on the grounds that the company lacked locus standi to initiate the action. At the time the suit was commenced, Kowus Motors had already ceased to exist due to a statutory merger under the Transfer of Shares and Merger (Kowus Motors, Kaasbohrer Ghana Limited and Ghana Assembly Plant) Decree, 1979 (AFRCD 60), which merged it into Automotive and Technical Services Limited (ATS). Despite the subsequent repeal of AFRCD 60 by the Statute Law Revision Act, 1997 (Act 543), the repeal did not automatically revive the company’s legal existence. The Court held that an action brought by a non-existent corporate entity is a nullity, citing both local and English authorities. The respondents’ late-raised point of law was entertained under an exception to procedural rules because it raised a substantial legal issue determinable without additional evidence. The appeal was dismissed.",
