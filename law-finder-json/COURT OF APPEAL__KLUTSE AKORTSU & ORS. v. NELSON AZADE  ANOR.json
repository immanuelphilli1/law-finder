  "summary": "The case KLUTSE AKORTSU & ORS. v. NELSON AZADE ANOR, heard by the Ghana Court of Appeal on 21st January 1999, concerned a land dispute between two families over ownership of the Afevu Grassland in Ho. The plaintiffs claimed customary ownership based on the rule that forest landowners automatically own adjacent grasslands. Prior to litigation, both parties participated in a dispute-resolution process involving elders and payment of fees, which the Court of Appeal assessed as an attempted arbitration. However, the arbitration was invalidated due to a breach of natural justice, as some arbitrators were family elders directly connected to the litigants. The Court further ruled that the plaintiffs were not bound by the arbitration's outcome and were entitled to pursue their claim in court. Additionally, the court found that the survey plan (Exhibit One) inaccurately represented the disputed land by labeling it as Hagble and Kohoe, which the plaintiffs disclaimed, undermining its evidentiary reliability. Lastly, the court held that the existence of the alleged customary rule linking forest and grassland ownership required formal judicial inquiry under Section 55 of the Courts Act, 1993 (Act 459), which the trial court had failed to conduct. The appeal was therefore allowed, and the Circuit Court’s judgment was set aside.",

The plaintiffs were not bound by its findings and were entitled to sue in court. The survey plan was deemed flawed, and the trial court erred in presuming the existence of a customary rule without proper inquiry under Section 55 of the Courts Act, 1993. The appeal was allowed, and the Circuit Court’s judgment was set aside.",
