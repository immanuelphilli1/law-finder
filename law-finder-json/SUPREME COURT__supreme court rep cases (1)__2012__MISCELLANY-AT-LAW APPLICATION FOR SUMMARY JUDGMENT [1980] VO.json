  "summary": "In Bronya v. Asafo II, the High Court at Cape Coast refused an application for summary judgment in a land possession dispute, holding that the applicant failed to comply with the requirements of the newly amended Order 14 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules. Wuaku J. ruled that, under Order 14, r. 2 (1), the applicant must either clearly state the reliefs sought or attach a statement of claim detailing the facts and grounds of the claim. Additionally, the affiant must have personal knowledge of the facts and must swear that the defendant has no defence. The court found that the deponent lacked personal knowledge, rendering the affidavit insufficient. The decision underscores the procedural rigor now required under the amended rules.",
