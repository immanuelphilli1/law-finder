  "summary": "This legal analysis examines the tension between Section 96(7)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1960 (Act 30), which mandates refusal of bail in murder cases, and constitutional protections under Articles 15(3)(b) and (4) of the 1969 Constitution (re-enacted in 1979 as Article 21) guaranteeing the right to liberty and protection against unreasonable delay in trial. The case of Republic v Crentsil is central, where bail was initially granted due to lack of disclosed evidence, but the state sought rescission based on new forensic findings linking the accused to the crime. The High Court held that even without breach of bail conditions, courts possess inherent power to rescind bail when new evidence emerges rendering the original decision injudicious or illegal. Crucially, the court found that a 'proper charge of murder' had not been established on the evidence, meaning Section 96(7)(a) did not apply to bar bail. The decision underscores that bail in murder cases hinges on whether the prosecution has met the evidential burden to prove a case to answer, aligning with standards at committal or trial. The analysis also clarifies that district courts lack jurisdiction to grant bail in murder cases outside committal proceedings, emphasizing procedural and constitutional safeguards in pre-trial detention.",
