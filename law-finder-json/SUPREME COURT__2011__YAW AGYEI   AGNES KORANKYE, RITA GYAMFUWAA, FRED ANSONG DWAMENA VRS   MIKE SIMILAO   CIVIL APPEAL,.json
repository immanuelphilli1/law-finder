  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision arose from an appeal against the dismissal of an interlocutory injunction application by the High Court, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal. The appellants argued that the High Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the motion because it was not listed on the cause list for November 1, 2007. The Supreme Court held that the absence of a case from the cause list does not nullify proceedings where parties had prior notice of the hearing date and were present in court. It emphasized that a cause list serves as informational notice, not a jurisdictional prerequisite. The Court found that compliance with Order 25 of the High Court Civil Procedure Rules—filing of statements of case and affidavits—enabled the court to decide the matter on the papers. It affirmed that judicial discretion governs the hearing of motions and appellate courts should not interfere absent demonstrable error. The appeal was dismissed, affirming the lower courts' decisions.",
