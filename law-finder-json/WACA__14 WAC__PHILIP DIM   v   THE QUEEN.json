  "caseTitle": "PHILIP DIM v THE QUEEN",
  "summary": "The appellant, Philip Dim, was convicted of murdering his wife by attacking her with a pickaxe-head in the early hours of the morning. He claimed a 'black-out' due to mental illness, asserting he had no memory of the event. The trial judge rejected this defence, finding no supporting medical or testimonial evidence. On appeal, it was argued that the prosecution failed to prove intent, that the judge misdirected himself on the insanity defence, and that the Crown should have led medical evidence on sanity. The West African Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that intent to murder could be inferred from the violent act, that the burden of proving insanity lies with the defence under Section 27 of the Criminal Code, and that the trial judge was correct in requiring credible evidence to support the 'black-out' claim, which was absent.",

  "confidenceNotes": "The decision is confidently reconstructed from the provided text, which appears to be a digitized version of a colonial-era West African Court of Appeal judgment. While the jurisdiction references Nigeria, the inclusion of 'WACA/14 WAC' and the source domain suggest relevance to Ghana's legal history under the shared West African judicial system. All legal principles and citations are directly extracted from the judgment.",
