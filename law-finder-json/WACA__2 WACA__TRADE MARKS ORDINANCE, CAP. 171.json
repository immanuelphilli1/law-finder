  "caseTitle": "IN THE MATTER OF TRADE MARKS ORDINANCE, CAP",
  "summary": "This 1935 West African Court of Appeal decision dismissed an appeal by the Netherlands Distillery against the registration of trade marks Nos. 2534, 2537, and 2538 by J.H. Henkes' Distillery in the Gold Coast (now Ghana). The appellant argued the marks resembled its No. 168 mark and were likely to deceive, but the court found the evidence insufficient to shift the onus of proof. The court held that opinions on resemblance from deponents were inadmissible, and no evidence of actual confusion was presented. It emphasized the respondent's prior and continuous use of crowns and medals in trade marks since at least 1904, undermining claims of exclusivity. The court also clarified that decisions of the Nigerian Full Court were not binding in the Gold Coast. With no proof of deception and significant differences in the marks, the appeal was dismissed with costs.",
