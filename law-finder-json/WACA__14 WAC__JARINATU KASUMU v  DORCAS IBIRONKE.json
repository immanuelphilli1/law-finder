  "summary": "In Jarinatu Kasumu v. Dorcas Ibironke, the appellant landlord sought recovery of premises from the respondent tenant, who had built structures on a leased plot of land with the landlord's knowledge. The landlord argued the lease was for vacant land and thus not protected under the Increase of Rent (Restriction) Ordinance. The trial Magistrate ruled the tenant lost protection after 12 years, but the Supreme Court reversed, recognizing the tenant's occupancy and use of built premises. The West African Court of Appeal upheld this, holding that the landlord’s continued acceptance of rent and description of the holding as 'rooms' established a monthly tenancy of a dwelling, entitling the tenant to statutory protection under the Ordinance.",
