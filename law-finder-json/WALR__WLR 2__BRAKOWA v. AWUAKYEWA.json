  "caseTitle": "BRAKOWA VERSUS AWUAKYEWA",
  "summary": "In Brakowa v. Awuakyewa, the plaintiff appealed a Land Court decision affirming a Native Court judgment that allowed the sale of her cocoa farm in execution of a debt for which she was a surety. She contended that the writ of summons in the original suit had never been served on her, rendering the judgment and subsequent sale void. The West African Court of Appeal held that service was neither admitted nor proved in accordance with Regulation 49 of the Native Court (Colony) Procedure Regulations, 1945, as the defendant failed to call the bailiff or produce a valid certificate of service. The court emphasized that where service is disputed, the best evidence—namely, oral testimony from the serving officer—must be presented. Additionally, the court found it an abuse of discretion to deny joinder of the property purchaser, as his interests were directly affected and multiplicity of suits should be avoided. The appeal was allowed, and the matter remitted for rehearing.",
