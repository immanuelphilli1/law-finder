  "caseTitle": "EFFU AH KW AKUW AH",
  "summary": "This case involved a dispute over ownership of land and a building in Yamoransa, Ghana, under Native Customary Law. The plaintiff, Effu Ah Kwakuwah, claimed ownership of part of a building constructed by her late husband, Kwamin Assimaku, who allegedly gifted her a portion during his lifetime. The Native Tribunal rejected her claim, ruling that the gift was invalid due to lack of public acknowledgment and customary thank-offering, as required by Fanti Customary Law. The Provincial Commissioner reversed this decision, citing the plaintiff's contributions and valid disposal of self-acquired property. On further appeal, the West Africa Court of Appeal restored the Native Tribunal's judgment, emphasizing that findings on customary law by native tribunals should not be disturbed without clear proof of error. The court held that the gift failed to meet customary requirements for validity, particularly public witnessing and acceptance through presents. The appeal was allowed, costs awarded to the appellant.",
