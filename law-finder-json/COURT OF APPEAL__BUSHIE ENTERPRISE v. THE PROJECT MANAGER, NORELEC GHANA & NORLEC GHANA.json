  "caseTitle": "BUSHIE ENTERPRISE v. THE PROJECT MANAGER, NORELEC GHANA",
  "summary": "This appeal arose from a construction contract dispute between Bushie Enterprise (sub-contractor) and Norelec Ghana (contractor) over the excavation and erection of 221 steel towers for a 34.5 KV electricity transmission line. The respondent claimed the appellants breached the contract by unilaterally reducing the number of towers from 221 to 42 and terminating work without proper notice under Clauses 1.7 and 3.1 of the agreement. The trial court found in favor of the respondent, holding the termination was wrongful. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the trial judge erred in focusing solely on Clause 1.7, which requires notice and default, while failing to consider Clause 2.1, which permits the contractor to reduce the scope of work without termination. The appellate court found that the appellants lawfully exercised their rights under Clause 2.1 to reduce the work, and the respondent accepted this by initialling the revised scope and performing accordingly. Thus, there was no breach of contract, and the judgment of the lower court was set aside.",
