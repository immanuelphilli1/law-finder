  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana, in Odametey v Clocuh and Nartey v Mechanical Lloyd Assembly Plant Ltd, addressed key issues under the Land Registry Act, 1962 (Act 122). The court rejected the doctrine of constructive registration, holding that unregistered instruments are ineffective regardless of presentation for registration. It affirmed that registration confers constructive notice under section 25(1), binding even landholding stools to notice of unauthorized grants. The majority held that priority between competing instruments is determined by registration date under section 26. The court also clarified that valid customary law grants transfer title independently of registration, and subsequent documentary conveyances purporting to transfer already-disposed rights are ineffective. Administrative failures by the Land Registry do not override statutory registration requirements.",
