  "caseTitle": "IN THE MATTER OF: THE CONCESSIONS ORDINANCE CERTIFICATE OF VALlDITY No",
  "summary": "This West African Court of Appeal decision from Accra on 4th December 1939 concerned a civil claim for the recovery of ₤250 in rents collected by the appellant, J.B. Amegashie, from a concession land after the respondents had legally purchased the land. The original grantors, representatives of the Klevie tribe, had granted the concession to Hans Schumann, later held by Basle Trading Co. Ltd. The first respondent was declared purchaser of the land interest in 1934, with conveyance to the second respondent in 1937. The appellant collected rents from 1934 to 1936 as agent and was sued for refund. The appeal challenged the trial court's jurisdiction, arguing the matter related to land ownership and thus belonged in a Native Tribunal under Section 48(2)(c) of the Native Administration Ordinance. The appellate court held that ownership was res judicata, and the claim was essentially for money had and received, not land rights, thus within the court's jurisdiction. It further ruled that a purchaser can enforce rights even without endorsement of the Certificate of Validity by the Concessions Court, rejecting the argument that such endorsement was a prerequisite. The amendment of the writ to include a claim for money had and received was upheld as non-prejudicial and procedurally sound.",
