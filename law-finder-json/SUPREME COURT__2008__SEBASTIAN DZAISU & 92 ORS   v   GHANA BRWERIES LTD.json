  "caseTitle": "SEBASTIAN DZAISU & 92 ORS v GHANA BRWERIES LTD",
  "summary": "In this labor rights case, 93 former casual workers of Ghana Breweries Ltd. appealed to the Supreme Court of Ghana after losing at both the High Court and Court of Appeal. They claimed they performed the same work as permanent employees but were denied benefits under the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), and sought declarations of unconstitutionality, back pay, and damages for wrongful termination. The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' rulings, emphasizing that the appellants failed to meet the burden of proof by providing concrete evidence that their duties were substantially similar to those of permanent workers. Although the trial court initially accepted their claim due to lack of cross-examination, the Court of Appeal rightly reversed this, noting the absence of evidentiary support. The Supreme Court affirmed that a bare assertion in court, without elaboration or corroborative testimony, does not fulfill the evidential burden, and that appellate courts may correct factual findings unsupported by evidence. The appeal was dismissed.",
