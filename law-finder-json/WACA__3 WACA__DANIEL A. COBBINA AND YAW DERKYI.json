  "summary": "In this West Africa Court of Appeal decision from 1936, the appellant, Kweku Edusei, successfully appealed the lower court's order rescinding a mortgage executed by plaintiffs Daniel A. Cobbina and Yaw Derkyi. The plaintiffs had sought rectification or rescission of the mortgage on grounds of mistake or fraud, primarily due to the non-disclosure of a $50 sum paid by co-sureties to secure a stay of execution. The lower court found the $50 to be part-payment, justifying rescission. However, the appellate court held that the $50 was a deposit, not payment, based on witness credibility, prior native tribunal findings, and the implausibility of the lower court's interpretation. Consequently, the rescission order was set aside. The court recalculated the balance due from $58 5s. 6d. to $131 8s. 6d., including the deposit and correcting other accounting errors. The plaintiffs were granted six months to redeem the mortgaged cocoa farms by paying the full amount and costs, with the appellant awarded costs in both courts.",
