  "caseTitle": "ERIC OMAN MENSAH, BENJAMIN OBOUR MENSAH VRS MR. PAT YAWSON",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision arose from a civil land dispute between the Mensah brothers (respondents) and Mr. Pat Yawson and George Edusei-Poku (appellants). The respondents claimed title to land in Tudu, Accra, based on ancestral acquisition since 1911, supported by a Land Title Certificate. The appellants contested this, citing a boundary dispute and counterclaiming for title, trespass damages, and cancellation of the Certificate alleging fraud. The trial court and Court of Appeal focused on title, but the Supreme Court identified the core issue as the unresolved boundary. It found the trial judge erred by relying on unverified site plans (Exhibits 1, 2, and CB3) without properly utilizing the court-ordered survey, failing to record her locus in quo visit, and rejecting the surveyor's evidence without reason. The Court of Appeal failed to provide cogent justification for these errors. Consequently, the Supreme Court allowed the appeal, setting aside the lower courts' judgments and ordering a fresh hearing to properly determine the exact boundaries based on admissible evidence.",
