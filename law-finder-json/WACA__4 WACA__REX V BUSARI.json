  "caseTitle": "REX V BUSARI",
  "summary": "This 1938 West African Court of Appeal decision arose from a case stated by Graham Paul, J. of the High Court in Ibadan, concerning the admissibility of a medical report in a summary trial for manslaughter. The accused, Busari, was charged with the manslaughter of Ashawande. The trial judge refused to admit a post-mortem report under Section 76A(1) of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance, interpreting the phrase 'or in any summary trial' as excluding summary trials before the High Court. He expressed concern that admitting such reports without the possibility of cross-examination would create an anomalous evidentiary regime. The Crown appealed the evidentiary ruling. The West African Court of Appeal held that the phrase 'or in any summary trial' in Section 76A(1) includes summary trials before the High Court. However, the Court clarified that 'shall be receivable' means the report is admissible but not mandatory; the trial judge retains discretion to exclude it if better evidence is available or for other valid reasons. The appeal was allowed in terms of the legal principle, though the accused had already been discharged.",
