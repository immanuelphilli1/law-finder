  "caseTitle": "REX V AJEGE AND KIGBO",
  "summary": "This appeal from the West Africa Court of Appeal quashed the murder convictions of Ajegbe and Kigbo, who were tried in Womba, Kaduna Judicial Division. The trial suffered multiple procedural irregularities: hearsay evidence from a local chief's investigation was wrongly admitted; uncautioned statements by the accused were accepted without proper warnings; and the appellant Ajegbe was taken to the scene of the crime in an attempt to extract a confession. Ajegbe testified that he made a false confession after being promised release and a reward by the District Head, and given halfpenny to buy food, creating a clear inducement. The court held that the so-called confession was valueless due to these improper influences. Despite the nominal admissibility of the statement at the preliminary inquiry, its reliability was negligible. With no direct evidence linking the appellants to the murder and serious breaches of fair trial principles, the court allowed the appeal and set aside the convictions.",
