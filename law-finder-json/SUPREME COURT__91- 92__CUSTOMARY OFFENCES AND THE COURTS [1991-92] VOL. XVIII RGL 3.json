  "summary": "This legal commentary by Justice Acquah G. K. examines the historical development and judicial treatment of customary offences in Ghana. It traces the evolution from pre-colonial indigenous justice systems, where chiefs held judicial authority over customary taboos and offences, through British colonial reforms including the Bond of 1844 and subsequent ordinances that limited but preserved native jurisdiction. The paper highlights that while serious crimes were transferred to British judicial officers, native courts retained authority over specified customary offences—provided they were not repugnant to natural justice, equity, and good conscience. The author discusses various examples of customary offences, such as invoking fetishes, adultery under Dagomba custom, and disrespecting oaths or chiefs, and reviews key cases where such matters were adjudicated. The analysis underscores the tension between traditional authority and formal legal systems, and raises questions about the legitimacy and enforceability of certain customs within modern jurisprudence.",
