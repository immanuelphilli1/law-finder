  "summary": "In Dasi Akakpo & Anor. v. Ben Johnson & Anor. (C.A. 80/98), the Court of Appeal of Ghana allowed the appellants' appeal against a trial court judgment that had granted various reliefs to the respondents, including declarations, damages, and injunctions. The Court held that the trial judge erred in applying the Rent Act, 1963 (Act 220), which does not apply to vacant land, as confirmed by the respondents' own pleadings that only bare land was granted. The respondents were found to be licensees, not statutory tenants, and were given three months' reasonable notice to quit, making their ejectment lawful. The joinder of the plaintiff's husband as co-plaintiff was invalid under L.I. 1129, Order 15, r.5(3), as it lacked written consent. The Court found contradictions in the respondents' testimony regarding the demolition of structures, supporting the appellants' claim that the removal was voluntary. Consequently, all reliefs granted to the respondents—declarations, damages, and injunction—were set aside as legally unsustainable.",
