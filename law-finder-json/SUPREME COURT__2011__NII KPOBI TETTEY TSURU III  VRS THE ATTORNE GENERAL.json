  "caseTitle": "NII KPOBI TETTEY TSURU III VRS THE ATTORNE GENERAL",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana judgment, delivered on April 13, 2011, addresses a review application by Nii Kpobi Tettey Tsuru III against the Attorney-General. The central issue was whether the Court's earlier 4-1 majority decision—holding that Article 20(5) and (6) of the 1992 Constitution did not apply to land compulsorily acquired by the state in 1947—should be reversed. The applicant argued that the prior decision was per incuriam, having failed to properly consider Article 257(1) and (2), which vests all public lands in the President on behalf of the people. The Court emphasized that while compulsory acquisition before 1992 is not subject to constitutional scrutiny, any post-1992 change in use of such land falls under Article 20(5) and (6), which guarantee compensation for property taken for public purpose. The judgment reviewed principles of review jurisdiction under Article 133(1) and Rule 54 of C.I. 16, affirming that review is warranted in cases of fundamental error, such as overlooking binding constitutional provisions, rendering an absurd decision, or inadequate consideration of vital matters. The Court highlighted that Article 20(5) and (6) are not limited to post-1992 acquisitions and must apply to any change in use of public land after the Constitution’s enactment. Although the judgment stops short of a final ruling due to truncation, it strongly indicates that the original decision may have been erroneous and in need of review.",
