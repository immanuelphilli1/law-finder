  "summary": "This 1938 West African Court of Appeal decision in Accra addressed an application for special conditional leave to appeal by the defendant-appellant, Opanyin Kwaku Twum, following a judgment in the Divisional Court. Although the appeal was filed just within the time limit and lacked sufficient medical evidence to justify delay, the Court granted leave as it was among the first applications under new rules, refusing to set a precedent. The Court found that seven of eight consolidated claims involved land valued below £100, thus not qualifying for appeal as of right under section 3(1) of the West African Court of Appeal Ordinance (Cap. 5). However, recognizing a potential legislative oversight, the Court exercised its discretionary power under section 8 to entertain the appeal, given that the cases originated from a native tribunal where a full right of appeal would have existed absent transfer. Conditions for appeal were imposed, including payment and security for costs, and costs of the motion were awarded against the appellant.",
