  "caseTitle": "REX v EILIX ONYINKE AND THREE OTHERS",
  "summary": "The West Africa Court of Appeal was asked to determine whether Buraimoh Biu, a convicted murderer under sentence of death, was a competent witness at trial. At common law, such a person was not competent due to 'attainder,' rendering them civilly dead, as held in R. v. Webb (1867). However, the Court found that the Forfeiture Act 1870 abolished attainder and corruption of blood for treason or felony. Section 1 of the Act clearly states that conviction does not result in attainder. Therefore, the legal basis for disqualifying such a person as a witness was removed. The Court concluded that a convicted murderer under sentence of death is a competent witness, answering the case stated in the affirmative.",
