  "summary": "This 1957 West African Court of Appeal decision addressed whether the court retained jurisdiction to order a stay of execution after granting leave to appeal to the Privy Council. The defendants had obtained leave on July 27, 1956, and filed a stay application on July 31; the court issued a conditional stay on October 30, 1956. The plaintiffs moved to set aside the order, arguing lack of jurisdiction. The court held that under section 8 of the West African (Appeal to Privy Council) Order in Council, 1949, its power to direct execution or stay is limited to the moment of granting leave. Since the application was decided months later, the order was a nullity. Relying on precedent from Osei Bonsu III v. Kwasi Adu and Smurthwaite v. Hannay, the court set aside its October 30 order, affirming that jurisdiction cannot be exercised after the grant of leave without express statutory authority.",
