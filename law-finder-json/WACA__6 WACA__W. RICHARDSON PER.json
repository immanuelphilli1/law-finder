  "caseTitle": "CHIEF THOMAS W. RICHARDSON VERSUS THOMAS",
  "summary": "This 1940 West Africa Court of Appeal decision from Accra involved a land dispute between J. W. Richardson and Thomas Eshun in Agona Swedru, Gold Coast (now Ghana). The case originated in the Paramount Tribunal of the Agona State, where the plaintiff’s claim for trespass damages was dismissed. On appeal to the Provincial Commissioner’s Court, the judgment was reversed, awarding nominal damages. The West Africa Court of Appeal found both the original trial and appeal unsatisfactory due to complex legal questions involving English-language documents and disputes over precise land measurements without adequate survey evidence. The appeal court set aside both judgments and remitted the case for a de novo hearing before the Native Tribunal, strongly recommending transfer to the Divisional Court under Section 75 of the Native Administration Ordinance (Cap. 76) due to the legal complexity.",
