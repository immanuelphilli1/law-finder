  "caseTitle": "BAFUNKE BRAITHWAITE",
  "summary": "This 1938 West African Court of Appeal decision involved interpleader proceedings initiated by BaFunke Braithwaite and Victoria Aduke against A. Folarin, an executing judgment creditor. The plaintiffs claimed ownership of attached property, asserting a prior disposition from the debtor. The lower court ordered release of the attachment, citing lack of local law voiding family dispositions made during financial distress, though expressing concern over creditor protection. The appellate court held that Section 13 Elizabeth Cap. 5, a statute of general application under English common law, remained applicable in Nigeria via Section 14 of the Supreme Court Ordinance, despite its 1925 repeal in England. The court found the trial judge misdirected himself by assuming no such law existed in Nigeria. Citing Re Holland (1902), the court emphasized that fraudulent intent must be assessed from all circumstances. The appeal was allowed, the judgment set aside, and the case remitted for factual findings on fraud. The appellant was awarded costs in the appellate court.",
