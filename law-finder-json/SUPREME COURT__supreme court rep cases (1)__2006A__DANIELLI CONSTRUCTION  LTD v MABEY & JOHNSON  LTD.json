  "caseTitle": "DANIELLI CONSTRUCTION LTD v MABEY & JOHNSON LTD",
  "summary": "In this civil appeal before the Ghanaian Supreme Court, Danielli Construction Ltd (Appellant) and Mabey & Johnson Ltd (Respondent) entered into an agreement to swap construction equipment: a piling hammer and Audi saloon car for a Toyota Hilux pick-up and mobile crushing plant. The trial court found a hiring contract and awarded damages for breach, which the Court of Appeal partially upheld, awarding cedi equivalent of $890,411. The Supreme Court reversed this decision, holding that the agreement was a swap, not a hire. It found that the defendant had constructively delivered the crushing plant by making it available for collection at its site, in line with mutual practice. The plaintiff's failure to collect the equipment did not constitute breach by the defendant. The Supreme Court held the Court of Appeal erred in law by awarding speculative damages without factual basis and misapplying the mode of delivery. Consequently, the appeal was allowed, the judgment of the Court of Appeal was set aside, and the defendant was discharged from liability.",
