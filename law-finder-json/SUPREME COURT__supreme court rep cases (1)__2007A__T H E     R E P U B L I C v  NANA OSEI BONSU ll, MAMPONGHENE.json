  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case arose from a chieftaincy dispute concerning the installation of Nana Yaa Adwubi as Mamponghemaa (queenmother) of Asante Mampong. The appellants, supporters of a rival nominee, claimed the installation on 29 February 2000 violated custom and constituted contempt of an injunction issued by the Ashanti Regional House of Chiefs. The core issue was whether the enstoolment occurred on 7 February or 29 February 2000. The appellants argued that installation required additional rites such as confinement and possession of stool regalia, while the respondents maintained that the 7 February event—comprising nomination, approval by kingmakers, and acceptance by the nominee—constituted full enstoolment under Mampong custom. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s reversal of contempt convictions, finding that the 7 February event satisfied local customary requirements. It emphasized that customary law is specific to each community and need not include universal rites. The court discredited the affidavit of Nana Afua Saka due to false claims about her tenure as acting queenmother and found greater credibility in the affidavits of recognized traditional authorities. Thus, the installation was valid, and no contempt occurred.",
