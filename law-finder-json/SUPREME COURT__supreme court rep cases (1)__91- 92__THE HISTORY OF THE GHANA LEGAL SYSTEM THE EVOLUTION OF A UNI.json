  "caseTitle": "THE HISTORY OF THE GHANA LEGAL SYSTEM THE EVOLUTION OF A UNI",
  "summary": "This legal-historical analysis traces the evolution of Ghana's national court system from pre-colonial indigenous institutions to a unified colonial judiciary under British rule. Prior to European contact, Ghanaian societies had organized political and judicial structures, including village tribunals, divisional chief courts, and paramount chief courts, emphasizing reconciliation and social cohesion. With the arrival of the Portuguese in 1471 and later British influence, a dual legal system emerged. The British established petty debt courts in the 1820s, limited initially to forts, and expanded jurisdiction over time. The Bond of 1844 and the British Settlements Act of 1841 laid the foundation for formal legal institutions. The first Supreme Court was established in 1853, applying English common law, while recognizing customary law unless it was deemed 'barbarous' or contrary to natural justice. The 1876 Supreme Court Ordinance re-established a comprehensive Supreme Court with appellate and divisional divisions, marking a shift toward centralized colonial administration following the Ashanti wars. The analysis highlights the interplay between trade, political control, and legal development in shaping Ghana's modern judiciary.",
