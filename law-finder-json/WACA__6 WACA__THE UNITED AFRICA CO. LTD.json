  "caseTitle": "THE UNITED AFRICA CO. LTD",
  "summary": "This 1940 West Africa Court of Appeal decision involved a claim by The United Africa Co. Ltd. against Paul Jazzar, who acted as surety for John Naoum, a produce buyer who died while indebted to the company. The plaintiff sought £141 1s. 6d. under a guarantee agreement dated 3rd January 1938. The defendant argued that non-disclosure of Naoum's pre-existing debit balances (approximately £12 in November 1937 and £90 in January 1938) invalidated the guarantee. The court rejected this, holding that a guarantee does not require full disclosure unless there is fraud or misrepresentation, and the surety had the duty to inquire about the risk. Since the surety knew that debit balances were a normal part of the business relationship and could have examined the ledger, non-disclosure did not discharge his liability. The appeal was dismissed, affirming the trial court’s judgment for the plaintiff.",
