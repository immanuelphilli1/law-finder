  "caseTitle": "OTHERS VERSUS BOTCHWAY.",
  "summary": "In Vanderpuye and Others v. Botchway, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council addressed whether a dispute over the distribution of a deceased Ga man's estate was a land cause or a succession matter under the Native Courts (Colony) Ordinance, Cap. 98. The appellants, children from 'six-cloth' marriages, had obtained a declaration of entitlement to the estate and an accounting of rents from the Ga Native Court. The respondent, a matrilineal cousin and family head, appealed to the Land Court, which reclassified their share as one-third. The West African Court of Appeal upheld Land Court jurisdiction, treating the case as a land cause. The Privy Council reversed this, holding that the real issue was succession, not land ownership. It reaffirmed that 'suits and matters relating to the succession to property' include determining shares, distribution, and valuation of estates under customary law. The jurisdictional test is the substance of the dispute, not the form of pleading. Thus, the Land Court lacked jurisdiction, and the appeal was properly one for succession, to be heard by the District Commissioner’s Court under prior practice.",
