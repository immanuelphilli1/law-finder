  "caseTitle": "REX V IBRAHIM BAUCHI",
  "summary": "This 1938 West African Court of Appeal decision arose from a case stated by the High Court concerning the admissibility of previous convictions under Section 417(c) of the Criminal Code in relation to possession at night of instruments of housebreaking. The appellate court held that while a judge may be informed of prior convictions (as they are not subject to the same evidentiary restrictions as a jury), such convictions must not be disclosed to a jury unless legally permissible or an essential element of the offence. The court affirmed that an accused must be notified before pleading if prior convictions will be used to justify an enhanced sentence. It further ruled that a formal written notice practice, while unobjectionable, is unnecessary provided proper procedural notice is given. The court upheld sub-paragraph (b) of the lower court's ruling as correct in law but rejected sub-paragraph (a) for incorrectly applying jury-based evidentiary rules to judicial proceedings.",
