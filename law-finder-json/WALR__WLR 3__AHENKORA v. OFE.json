  "caseTitle": "AHENKORA VERSUS OFE",
  "summary": "In Ahenkora v. Ofe, the Court of Appeal of Ghana considered the validity of a writ of certiorari challenging the Governor-General's confirmation of a committee of inquiry's report regarding a chieftaincy dispute. The committee had found that the predecessor of the respondent had not been validly destooled, a finding confirmed by the Governor-General. The applicant successfully obtained certiorari in the lower court, which was challenged on appeal. The Court held that the committee of inquiry performed a judicial function, and the Governor-General's act in confirming its report was judicial, not administrative, and thus subject to judicial review. The 'final and conclusive' language in the State Councils Ordinance did not oust the courts' supervisory jurisdiction. The Supreme Court possesses a distinct supervisory jurisdiction over both civil and criminal matters, exercisable through prerogative writs like certiorari, which cannot be easily excluded by statute. A State Council, when performing judicial functions, is an inferior tribunal subject to certiorari. The charges raised a constitutional dispute, validating the Governor-General's appointment of the committee and its findings.",
