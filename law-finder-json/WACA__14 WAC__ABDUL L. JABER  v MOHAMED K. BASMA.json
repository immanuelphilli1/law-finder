  "caseTitle": "ABDUL L. JABER v MOHAMED K. BASMA",
  "summary": "In this civil appeal before the West Africa Court of Appeal, the appellant (Mohamed K. Basma) had obtained a writ of possession against the head lessee (Abdul Radar), resulting in the Sheriff removing the respondent's (Abdul L. Jabar) stock and personal effects from the premises where he operated as a sub-tenant. The respondent, who had no notice of the prior proceedings, sued for trespass and loss of goods. The trial judge awarded special damages of \u0001400 (\u0001150 for cash, \u0001250 for goods) and \u0001100 in general damages. On appeal, the court held that although the sub-lease terminated upon judgment against the head lessee, rule 2 of Order 34 required notice to be served on the affected sub-tenant. It further ruled that special damages could not be awarded where the trial judge had substantially disbelieved the claimant's evidence, as strict proof is required. However, the court upheld the \u0001100 general damages, recognizing the serious inconvenience caused by the public removal of belongings. The appeal was allowed solely to set aside the special damages.",
