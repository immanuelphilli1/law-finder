  "summary": "This 1930 West African Court of Appeal decision involved an application for conditional leave to appeal to the Privy Council. The judgment awarded the plaintiffs-respondents a sum of £491 5s. 6d., which included interest. The appellant contended that costs should be included to exceed the £500 appeal threshold. The court rejected this, citing precedent that costs cannot be counted toward the appealable amount when the substantive judgment is below the threshold, as established in Doorga Chowdry v. Ramanauth Chowdry and Great Western Ry. of Canada v. Braid. The application was dismissed with costs.",
