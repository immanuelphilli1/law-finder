  "caseTitle": "ARTHUR VERSUS AYENSU.",
  "summary": "In Arthur v. Ayensu, the Supreme Court of Ghana, Central Judicial Division, held that the self-acquired property of a deceased intestate devolves not to the wider family group but to the immediate family defined by matrilineal descent—specifically, those tracing lineage through the mother or maternal grandmother of the deceased. The plaintiff, claiming as head of the broader Anona family, lacked standing to sue for recovery of the deceased's real property. Although the lower courts correctly dismissed the claim, their reasoning—that the administratrix (appointed for the personal estate only) was the proper party—was legally unsound. The correct basis was that the niece, Mrs. Faustina Daniels, was entitled by native customary law as a member of the immediate family to represent the deceased’s estate in relation to self-acquired property. The decision reaffirmed principles from Mensah Larkai v. Amorkor and distinguished the impact of the Marriage Ordinance, c. 127 of 1951, which alters devolution by vesting both real and personal property in the administrator for certain married intestates.",
