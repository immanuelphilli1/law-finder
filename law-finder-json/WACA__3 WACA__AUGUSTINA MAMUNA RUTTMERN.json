  "summary": "This 1937 West Africa Court of Appeal case involved a dispute over family land in Accra, Ghana, between grandchildren of Alfa Ruttmern. The plaintiffs, descendants of Alfa's son Nuffu by Ashetu, sought a declaration that the land was family property and that they were entitled to share in the rents, along with an account of rents collected since 1928 by the defendant, Emmanuel Candinho Ruttmer, descendant of Alfa's son Karimu by Fatuma. The central issue was whether Ashetu was lawfully married to Alfa under native law and custom. The trial court found in favor of the plaintiffs, and the appellate court upheld this decision. It held that the defendant's counsel's opening statement admitting the marriage under native custom was binding in the absence of pleadings, estopping the appellant from later contesting it. The court affirmed the finding that Ashetu was a senior wife to Fatuma, entitling her descendants to a share in the family property. It also confirmed the duty of the defendant and his brother Louis, as literate 'caretakers' managing family affairs, to account for collected rents under native custom and trust principles, rejecting defenses of laches and improper designation as caretaker. The appeal was dismissed.",
