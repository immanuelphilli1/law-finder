  "caseTitle": "SEMINAR ON THE TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS THE ROLE OF PAROLE IN2",
  "summary": "This 1989–90 Supreme Court of Ghana seminar paper by Danyagre J.S. examines the role of parole in criminal justice administration, emphasizing the humanitarian, reformative, and fiscal benefits of community-based corrections over prolonged incarceration. It critiques Ghana’s colonial-era prison system, highlighting overcrowding and the high social and economic costs of imprisonment. The paper outlines the parole process, including eligibility (after one-third of sentence or six months, whichever is later), selection via local review committees and a Parole Board, and supervision by probation officers. Parole is justified as a rehabilitative tool, institutional control mechanism, and means to reduce prison burdens. The author cites research indicating that long-term imprisonment may be criminogenic and that early release via parole correlates with lower recidivism. The paper calls for reforms to align the parole system with local needs.",
