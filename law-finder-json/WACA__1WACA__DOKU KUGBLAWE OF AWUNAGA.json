  "caseTitle": "DOKU KUGBLAWE OF AWUNAGA",
  "summary": "This 1931 West African Court of Appeal decision dismissed an appeal by Doku Kugblawe, who sought to have a judgment from the Native Tribunal of Anlo declared a nullity. The Divisional Court had previously ruled against him, holding it lacked jurisdiction. The Appellant argued the Native Tribunal was improperly constituted and its proceedings violated natural justice. The appellate court affirmed that Native Tribunals possess exclusive original jurisdiction over land disputes between natives under the Native Administration Ordinance, a jurisdiction expressly removed from the Supreme and Divisional Courts. The court held that such judgments could not be challenged in a Divisional Court via an independent action for nullity, especially after the Appellant failed to pursue a timely appeal to the Provincial Commissioner. The court emphasized that statutory appeal mechanisms must be followed and cannot be circumvented, confirming the lower court's judgment.",
