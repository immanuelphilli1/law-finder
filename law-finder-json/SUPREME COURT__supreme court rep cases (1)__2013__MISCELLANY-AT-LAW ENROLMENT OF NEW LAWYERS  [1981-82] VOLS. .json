  "summary": "This document presents an edited version of a speech delivered by Chief Justice F.K. Apaloo of Ghana on 17 December 1982 during the enrolment of new lawyers by the General Legal Council. The speech addresses the challenges facing the judiciary following the 31 December 1981 Revolution and the establishment of the Provisional National Defence Council (P.N.D.C.). While the P.N.D.C. claimed to preserve existing laws and judicial structures, the judiciary faced increasing interference, including attacks on court staff, obstruction of court orders, and the eventual abduction and murder of three High Court judges in July 1982. The Chief Justice defends the judiciary's restrained response, emphasizing the need to preserve judicial impartiality and avoid disqualification from future trials of the perpetrators. He highlights ongoing disruptions by People's Defence Committees (P.D.C.s) and Workers' Defence Committees (W.D.C.s), which have shut down courts and undermined judicial authority, raising concerns about the rule of law and the future of the legal profession in Ghana.",

  "confidenceNotes": "The document is an edited transcript of a public speech by the Chief Justice, providing high factual reliability on institutional perspectives. However, it reflects a single viewpoint (judicial) during a politically sensitive period. Some events, such as the investigation into the judges' murders, are reported based on rumors or official statements without independent verification. The text is truncated, potentially omitting later developments.",
