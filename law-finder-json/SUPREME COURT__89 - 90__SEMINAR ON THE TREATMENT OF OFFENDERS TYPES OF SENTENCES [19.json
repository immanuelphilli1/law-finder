  "caseTitle": "SEMINAR ON THE TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS TYPES OF SENTENCES [19",
  "summary": "This legal commentary by Her Ladyship Mrs. Akoto-Bamfo, delivered as a Circuit Judge and later Justice of the High Court of Ghana, outlines the types of sentences available under Ghanaian law as of 1989–1990. It emphasizes that all sentences must be grounded in statute and within the jurisdictional limits of the court, citing Republic v Addo [1974] GLR 254 to illustrate the illegality of exceeding prescribed penalties. The paper details various sentencing options including death, imprisonment, fines, probation, discharge, recognisance, compensation, and deportation. Mandatory death sentences apply to treason, murder, and aggravated piracy, though not for juveniles or pregnant women. Imprisonment terms vary by offence classification—felonies (life or up to 25 years), second-degree felonies (up to 10 years), and misdemeanours (up to 3 years). The commentary critiques outdated fines, calls for reclassification of offences, and advocates for non-custodial alternatives like communal labour, especially for non-violent or compensable offences. It also recommends expanding probation and payment plans, improving economic conditions to reduce crime, and reforming laws like Act 192 and Act 261 to enhance rehabilitation over incarceration.",
