  "caseTitle": "JOE SANDY v P.C. JOHANNES B. HOTOGUA AND ANOTHER",
  "summary": "The appellant, Joe Sandy, sued the Paramount Chief and another member of the Tribal Authority for damages for assault and false imprisonment after being detained following a Native Court judgment. The defendants claimed the detention was in lawful execution of the court's order, but no record existed of any such order. The trial judge incorrectly placed the burden on the plaintiff to prove the imprisonment was unlawful. The West African Court of Appeal held that the burden was on the defendants to justify the imprisonment, which they failed to do. Furthermore, the judgment was void because a party to the suit, Lahai Margaa, sat as a member of the Native Court, violating the principle against bias. With no valid court order and a procedurally flawed judgment, the detention was deemed unlawful. The appeal was allowed, the lower court's judgment set aside, and judgment entered for the plaintiff with damages of £100 awarded jointly and severally against the defendants.",
