  "summary": "The West Africa Court of Appeal reviewed the murder convictions of five appellants, upholding the convictions of four but allowing the appeal of the second accused due to judicial misdirection on the need for corroboration of accomplice evidence. The court held that the trial judge erred in relying on the testimony of Bokari Kamasso as corroboration, as no such corroboration existed. The court also ruled that a mutilated written statement by the first accused (Exhibit II) was improperly admitted, though the conviction stood due to other strong evidence, including a valid confession. The court criticized the trial court's practice of 'temporarily' admitting confessions subject to later challenge, emphasizing that factual issues like duress must be resolved before evidence is finally admitted, especially in trials with assessors. Despite the procedural flaw, no prejudice was found in this instance.",
