  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision resolved a chieftaincy dispute concerning the valid nomination and enstoolment of a new Omanhene for the Wenchi Traditional Area following the death of Nana Abrefa Mbore Bediatuo VII in 2004. The queen mother, Nana Atoaa Sramangyedua III, was constitutionally and customarily responsible for nominating a candidate. After a ruling by the Brong Ahafo Regional House of Chiefs in June 2006, the kingmakers repeatedly requested her to nominate a candidate within 24 hours, but she requested three weeks for consultations. The kingmakers, deeming her delay unreasonable, bypassed her and had Madam Abena Frema Atuahene nominate Kwadwo Nyam Nketia, who was subsequently enstooled. The queen mother and allied chiefs challenged this, leading to a reversal by the National House of Chiefs. On appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed that nomination is a sine qua non under Article 277 of the 1992 Constitution and Wenchi customary law, and that the queen mother’s request for time was reasonable. The Court held that only the queen mother could validly nominate, and her failure to act within 24 hours did not justify the kingmakers’ intervention. Thus, the nomination and enstoolment of Kwadwo Nyam Nketia were declared invalid.",
