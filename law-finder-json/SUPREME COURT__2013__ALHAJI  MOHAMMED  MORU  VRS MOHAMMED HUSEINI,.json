  "caseTitle": "ALHAJI MOHAMMED MORU VRS MOHAMMED HUSEINI,",
  "summary": "This is a civil land dispute before the Supreme Court of Ghana, arising from a conflict over ownership and possession of land at Sowutuom. The plaintiff, Alhaji Mohammed Moru, claimed the defendant, Mohammed Huseini, was a tenant who failed to pay rent and breached an oral agreement, seeking ejectment and recovery of possession. The defendant denied tenancy and counterclaimed ownership based on a 1997 lease from the Abola Piem (Tunma We) Family. The trial court ruled for the plaintiff, a decision upheld by the Court of Appeal. However, the Court of Appeal found the plaintiff's power of attorney void under the Power of Attorney Act, 1998 (Act 548), due to lack of attestation, thus invalidating the plaintiff's capacity to sue. Despite this, the Court upheld the judgment because the defendant failed to prove his counterclaim. The Supreme Court affirmed this outcome, stressing that while the plaintiff's case was defective, the defendant did not meet the burden of proving title, and concurrent findings of lower courts would not be disturbed absent a clear miscarriage of justice.",
