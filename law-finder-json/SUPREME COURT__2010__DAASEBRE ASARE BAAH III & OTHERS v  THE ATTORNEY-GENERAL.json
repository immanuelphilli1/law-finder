  "summary": "In this constitutional case, Paramount Chiefs and sub-Chiefs from Worawora, Bowiri, Apesokubi, Tapa, and Nkonya in the Volta Region challenged the creation of the Biakoye District and the establishment of its District Assembly. They argued that Executive Instrument (E.I.) 11 of 2007, which created the district, was unconstitutional because the President failed to direct the Electoral Commission to conduct a mandatory study under Section 1 of the Local Government Act, 1993 (Act 462). Additionally, they contested Legislative Instrument (L.I.) 1910 of 2008, which established the Biakoye District Assembly with Nkonya Ahenkro as capital, asserting it violated due process and decentralisation principles under Articles 240, 241, and 296 of the 1992 Constitution. This was because the choice of capital contradicted an earlier gazette notification naming Worawora and a memorandum of understanding among the chiefs. The Supreme Court emphasized the presumption of constitutionality and the need for precise allegations in constitutional challenges. It also reaffirmed the principle of severability, allowing invalid parts of legislation to be nullified without invalidating the whole. The plaintiffs sought declarations of nullity, an injunction, and consequential orders.",

  "verdict": "The Supreme Court held that the President's failure to comply with Section 1 of Act 462 before issuing E.I. 11 of 2007 rendered the instrument unconstitutional and void to the extent of non-compliance. The Court further found that the unilateral designation of Nkonya Ahenkro as the district capital, without consultation or adherence to due process, was arbitrary and inconsistent with constitutional principles of decentralisation. The naming of the capital was declared invalid. However, the Court applied the principle of severability, allowing the creation of the Biakoye District to stand while nullifying the unconstitutional aspects relating to procedure and capital designation.",
