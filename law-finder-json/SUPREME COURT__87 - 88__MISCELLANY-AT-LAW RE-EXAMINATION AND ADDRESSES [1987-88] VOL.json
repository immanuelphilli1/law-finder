  "summary": "This legal commentary by Sam Okudzeto discusses procedural aspects of trial practice in Ghana, focusing on re-examination of witnesses, judicial powers during trial, and the structure of final addresses. Re-examination is limited to clarifying points from cross-examination and must not be leading or introduce new issues without court permission. The court retains discretion under Section 69 and 73 of the Evidence Decree to control witness examination. Judges may question witnesses or call new ones in the interest of justice, especially in criminal cases, but must avoid bias. In civil cases, judicial calls for witnesses require party consent or lack of objection. The commentary highlights a historical case where rebuttal evidence was wrongly denied after a surprise expert testimony, leading to appellate reversal. Final addresses follow specific sequencing rules under the Criminal Procedure Code, with the prosecution usually having the last word. The piece critiques declining standards in oral advocacy and the growing use of written submissions, which may undermine procedural fairness.",
