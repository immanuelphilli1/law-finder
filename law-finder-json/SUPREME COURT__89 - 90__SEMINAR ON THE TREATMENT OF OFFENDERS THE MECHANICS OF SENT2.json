  "caseTitle": "SEMINAR ON THE TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS THE MECHANICS OF SENT2",
  "summary": "This academic paper presented at a seminar discusses the mechanics of sentencing in Ghana, focusing on the role of public tribunals established under PNDCL 78. It outlines three main theories of punishment—retributive, deterrent/preventive, and reformative—and critiques their application. The author notes that while judges and tribunals have broad discretion, sentencing often leans toward retributive or deterrent models, especially for serious economic and drug-related crimes. The paper highlights concerns about prison overcrowding, the failure of prisons to serve reformative purposes, and the influence of judicial bias. Special provisions for young offenders and alternatives like communal labour and fines are discussed, with criticism of the overreliance on imprisonment. The author calls for a dynamic, socially responsive sentencing policy.",
