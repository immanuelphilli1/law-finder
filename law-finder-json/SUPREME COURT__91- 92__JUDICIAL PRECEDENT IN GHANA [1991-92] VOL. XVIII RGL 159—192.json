  "summary": "The document titled 'Judicial Precedent in Ghana' appears to be an academic or judicial commentary discussing the application and significance of judicial precedent within Ghana's legal system. Given Ghana's common law heritage, the principle of stare decisis is central to legal reasoning and decision-making. The text likely examines how precedents set by higher courts, especially the Supreme Court, bind lower courts, and analyzes the conditions under which courts may depart from established precedents. It may also explore the role of precedent in ensuring consistency, predictability, and fairness in judicial outcomes.",
