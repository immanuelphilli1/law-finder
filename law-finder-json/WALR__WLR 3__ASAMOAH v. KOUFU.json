  "caseTitle": "ASAMOAH VERSUS KOUFU.",
  "summary": "In Asamoah v. Koufu, the High Court addressed the jurisdiction of a Native Court in a land dispute where the head of Awutu State sued a sub-chief of Fetteh State over land ownership. The case was initially heard in the Awutu Native Court, which ruled in favor of the plaintiff. On appeal, the High Court raised *sua sponte* the issue of whether the Native Court of the plaintiff's state could impartially adjudicate a claim involving its own state. The court held that such a tribunal could not be seen as impartial due to the inherent conflict of interest, citing the principle that justice must not only be done but must manifestly be seen to be done. Consequently, the judgment was set aside, and the matter was remitted for transfer to the Land Court via the Magistrate's Court. On costs, the court followed precedent by ordering each party to bear its own costs, as the jurisdictional issue was raised by the court, not the parties.",
