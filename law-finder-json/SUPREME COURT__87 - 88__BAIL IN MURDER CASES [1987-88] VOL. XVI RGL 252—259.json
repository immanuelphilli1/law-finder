  "summary": "In Republic v Crentsil, the Ghanaian High Court addressed the interpretation of section 96(7)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Decree, 1975 (NRCD 309), which appears to prohibit bail in murder cases. Justice Kpegah held that the provision does not completely oust judicial discretion to grant bail where the prosecution fails to present sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case of murder. The court emphasized that the mere charging of murder does not automatically trigger the bail prohibition; rather, there must be objective evidence supporting all essential elements of the offence. The judge distinguished the role of a bail court from that of a trial court, noting that pre-trial judges must assume the truth of prosecution evidence but should not engage in weighing its credibility or drawing inferences as a jury would. The decision clarified that bail may be withdrawn if new evidence emerges that establishes a prima facie case. The ruling reinforced that a scintilla of evidence is insufficient for committal or bail refusal, aligning with prior precedents and safeguarding individual liberty while recognizing the gravity of murder charges.",
