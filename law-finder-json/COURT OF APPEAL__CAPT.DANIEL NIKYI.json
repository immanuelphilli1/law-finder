  "caseTitle": "CAPT.DANIEL NIKYI",
  "summary": "This is a criminal appeal before the Ghana Court of Appeal concerning Capt. Daniel Nikyi, who sought an extension of time to apply for leave to appeal an interlocutory ruling that a prima facie case had been established against him, requiring him to enter his defence. The Republic opposed the application, arguing that the right of appeal had not accrued under the Armed Forces Act and related regulations, which prescribe a 90-day window to petition the commanding officer after conviction. The court held that interlocutory rulings, such as the finding of a prima facie case, are not independently appealable; instead, any challenge must be raised as a ground in an appeal against the final conviction. Citing legal authority, the court emphasized that a prima facie case is not equivalent to proof of guilt and that wrongful rejection of a 'no case to answer' submission may constitute an error of law, particularly where no evidence exists to support the case at that stage. The court dismissed the application, ruling that the proper course is to appeal the final conviction and include the alleged error as a ground of appeal.",
