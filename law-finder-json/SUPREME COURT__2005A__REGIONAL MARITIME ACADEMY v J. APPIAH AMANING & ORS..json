  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana in Regional Maritime Academy v J. Appiah Amaning & Ors. (2005) reversed the Court of Appeal's majority decision and restored the High Court's judgment in favor of the Regional Maritime Academy. The plaintiffs, former employees of the Academy, were retrenched in 1995 and claimed entitlement to end-of-service benefits calculated at two and a half months' salary per year of service, based on alleged agreements reached through union negotiations. The Supreme Court held that the Academy, as an international institution governed by P.N.D.C.L. 33, operates under the autonomous authority of its Board of Governors, which has exclusive power to determine employee conditions of service and financial obligations. The Court found no binding agreement approved by the Board, noting that negotiations involving the Principal and Ministry officials did not amount to enforceable commitments without Board ratification. Reliance was placed on precedents emphasizing that negotiation outcomes are not binding absent formal acceptance. The appeal was allowed, affirming that the plaintiffs' claims lacked legal foundation under the Academy's statutory and international framework.",
