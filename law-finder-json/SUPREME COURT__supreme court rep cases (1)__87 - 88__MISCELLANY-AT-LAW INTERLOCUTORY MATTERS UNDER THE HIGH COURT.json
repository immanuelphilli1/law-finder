  "caseTitle": "MISCELLANY-AT-LAW INTERLOCUTORY MATTERS UNDER THE HIGH COURT",
  "summary": "This legal commentary by Justice Adade N.Y.B. of the Ghanaian Supreme Court discusses interlocutory matters under the High Court Rules, focusing on injunctions, stay of execution, and aspects of pleadings. It explains that interlocutory orders are interim rulings made during litigation that do not finally determine the rights of the parties. The discussion emphasizes procedural requirements for injunctions under Order 50 and Order 52 of the High Court Rules, distinguishing between ex parte and inter partes applications, and highlighting the exceptional nature of ex parte injunctions, which must be time-limited and subject to prompt review. The paper also addresses the appointment of receivers, critiques the routine appointment of court registrars as receivers of disputed property, and touches upon the necessity of establishing a strong prima facie case for interim relief. Additionally, it outlines considerations courts must weigh when granting injunctions, such as hardship, status quo preservation, and adequacy of damages.",
