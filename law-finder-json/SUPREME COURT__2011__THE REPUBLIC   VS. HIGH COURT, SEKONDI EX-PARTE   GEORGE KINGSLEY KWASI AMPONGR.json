  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC VS. HIGH COURT, SEKONDI EX-PARTE GEORGE KINGSLEY KWASI AMPONGR",
  "summary": "This is a Supreme Court ruling on an application for certiorari to quash a High Court decision that had dismissed a prior judicial review application. The applicant, George Kingsley Kwasi Ampong (alias Odeneho Akrufa Krukoko II), sought to challenge a Chieftaincy Tribunal's default judgment declaring him destooled as Omanhene of Wassa Fiase Traditional Area in 2002. After the Tribunal dismissed his motion to set aside the judgment, he filed for judicial review at the Sekondi High Court, which was dismissed on 21 December 2010. He then approached the Supreme Court under its supervisory jurisdiction, largely reiterating the same grounds. The Supreme Court, per Akoto-Bamfo JSC, dismissed the application, holding that the High Court acted within its jurisdiction and that any non-jurisdictional errors must be addressed via appeal, not certiorari. The Court emphasized that certiorari is not a substitute for appeal and requires a clear error apparent on the face of the record, such as lack of jurisdiction or breach of natural justice. The additional ground—criticism of counsel by the High Court—was not sufficient to constitute a jurisdictional flaw. The application was thus dismissed.",
