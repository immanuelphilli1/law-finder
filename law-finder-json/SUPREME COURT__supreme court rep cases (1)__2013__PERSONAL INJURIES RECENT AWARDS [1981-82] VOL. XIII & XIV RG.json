  "caseTitle": "ATTAH v. NYAMESON (Owusu-Addo J.,",
  "summary": "This compilation from 1981\u00131982 by the Review of Ghana Law reports on personal injury awards from various High Court decisions across Ghana, primarily arising from road accidents, workplace incidents, and police actions. The cases cover fatal injuries, multiple traumas, and specific bodily injuries (arm, wrist, spine, leg). Awards are itemized into general damages (pain and suffering, loss of amenities), special damages (medical, transport, funeral), and pecuniary losses (loss of current and future earnings, dependency). Courts considered factors such as the victim's age, occupation, income, dependants, likelihood of remarriage (in dependency claims), degree of permanent disability, and specific life impacts like loss of consortium or inability to work. Notably, FLETCHER v. OPPONG involved a police shooting with a high award of over \u001c250,000, while DAGARTI v. STATE GOLD MINING CORPORATION addressed a mining accident leading to paraplegia. The methodology often included 'years' purchase' for future earnings and explicit recognition of mental distress and cosmetic deformity.",
