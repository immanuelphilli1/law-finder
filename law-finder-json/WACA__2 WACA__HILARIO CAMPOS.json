  "caseTitle": "HILARIO CAMPOS",
  "summary": "In this civil case before the West Africa Court of Appeal, the parties had consented to refer their dispute to a referee, each paying five guineas toward a ten-guinea fee. After settling the case out of court, the plaintiff sought a refund of his payment, leading to motions to set aside the original referral order. The court held that once a final judgment (or dismissal) has been entered, a court lacks competence to review an interlocutory order such as the referral to a referee. While noting the referee may be considered an officer of the court, the court emphasized that such a role terminates upon final disposition of the suit. The motion to set aside the order was dismissed, and costs were awarded to the referee.",
