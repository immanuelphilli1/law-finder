  "summary": "This consolidated appeal before the West African Court of Appeal on 31st October 1939 involved three land-related suits from the Nigerian judicial system, centering on the doctrine of res judicata. The trial judge had admitted evidence taken before a Referee 'for what it is worth' but later rejected it entirely without affording the parties an opportunity to present alternative evidence on the issue of res judicata. The appellate court held that this procedural misstep vitiated the judgment, as the parties had relied on the initial admission of the Referee's evidence and tailored their subsequent submissions accordingly. Consequently, the appeal was allowed, and the matter remitted to the lower court for further evidence on the res judicata issue. The costs of the appeal were awarded at 60 guineas, with costs in the court below to abide the final result.",
