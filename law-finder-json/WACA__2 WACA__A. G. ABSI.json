  "summary": "This 1935 West Africa Court of Appeal decision addressed a preliminary objection concerning the validity of an ex parte order granting an extension of time to appeal. The appellant sought to appeal a judgment from the Supreme Court of Sierra Leone, but the respondent raised a jurisdictional challenge, arguing that the extension of time was granted without proper notice. The Court held that such an order must be made on notice to both parties, as it affects the rights of both, and cannot be decided ex parte. Relying on Evennett v. Lawrence and court rules requiring notice, the Court found the extension order invalid because it was made ex parte, despite the respondent's solicitor being present but declining to participate. Consequently, the appeal was dismissed for non-compliance with procedural rules.",
