  "summary": "This Court of Appeal decision in F. A. Jantuah v. Mrs. Jane C. Jantuah and Anthony O. Jantuah, heard on 25th July 2002, concerned a dispute over property ownership following the death of the appellant's brother. The appellant claimed ownership of a house in Dichemso, Kumasi, and a cocoa farm in Atronie, asserting they were acquired through his funds. The respondents, the deceased’s widow and child, counterclaimed that both properties belonged to the deceased. The High Court found in favor of the respondents, and the Court of Appeal upheld this decision, affirming that the appellant failed to rebut the legal presumption that property titled in the deceased’s name belonged to him. The appellant had also abandoned his case during trial, leaving only the counterclaim for adjudication. The appellate court emphasized that the trial judge’s factual findings were well-supported by evidence and not perverse. Additionally, Justice Gbadegbe noted a procedural irregularity—allowing the appellant to present rebuttal evidence after discontinuing his case—and ordered that such evidence be expunged from the record. Ultimately, the appeal was dismissed, and the respondents' counterclaim was affirmed.",
