  "summary": "This 1955 West African Court of Appeal decision arose from a dispute over the interpretation of an agreement for the sale of a house in Kumasi, Gold Coast (now Ghana). The appellant, Osei Yaw, sued for specific performance of the agreement or, alternatively, the return of funds paid. The agreement specified a purchase price of £3,800, with the amount to be paid into court to settle a judgment debt of £2,556 and costs, and the balance to be drawn by the vendor, Opei Kumai. The vendor argued that the purchase price should be interpreted as £4,800, including a pre-existing mortgage debt of £1,000 owed to the purchaser. The court held that the agreement was unambiguous and that extrinsic evidence could not be admitted to vary its clear terms. The appeal was allowed, the lower court’s judgment was set aside, and the counterclaim dismissed.",
