  "caseTitle": "ABOTCHE KPONUGLO",
  "summary": "This Privy Council appeal from the Gold Coast Colony (modern-day Ghana) concerned a land dispute over 'Bunya land' between the Head Chief of Tafi Atome (respondent) and the Head Chief of Djokpee and his subjects (appellants). The respondent claimed damages for trespass and an injunction after the appellants cut down a tree on the land. The Supreme Court initially ruled for the appellants, finding their claim by conquest and traditional evidence superior, and that the respondent lacked exclusive possession. The West African Court of Appeal reversed, relying on German colonial maps and alleged acts of possession. The Privy Council restored the original judgment, holding that the German maps were unreliable due to their small scale and inaccuracies, and that partial use (farming, fish traps, roads) did not establish title to the entire tract. The Council emphasized the weight of traditional evidence and the trial judge's credibility findings, particularly rejecting the significance of an alleged arbitration and the 'Mahoon incident' due to lack of corroborative evidence. The appeal was allowed, affirming appellants' title.",
