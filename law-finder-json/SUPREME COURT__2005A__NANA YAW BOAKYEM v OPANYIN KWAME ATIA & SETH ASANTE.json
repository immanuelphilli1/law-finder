  "caseTitle": "<span style=\"font-family: Arial\">               <i>&quot; At the hearing of the case the Defendants and their witnesses were not impressive at all. In my opinion the stand they took was simply to deny flatly everything that the Plaintiff said. As a result they were very confused in their presentation and their counsel found it difficult to elicit simple facts or evidence he wanted to support their case. From their demeanor and the way answers were extracted from them we have no option but to disbelieve them. Weighing the evidence led by the plaintiff as against that led by Defendants. We find that of the plaintiff to be the truth. &quot;</i></span>",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana upheld the plaintiff's claim in a civil dispute, finding the defendants' testimony unconvincing and inconsistent. The court observed that the defendants and their witnesses denied all allegations without providing coherent evidence, leading to confusion during testimony. The plaintiff's evidence was deemed more credible and truthful. The judgment emphasized the importance of demeanor and consistency in witness testimony when assessing credibility. As a result, the court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, reinforcing the principle that bald denials unsupported by credible evidence cannot outweigh positive testimony.",
