  "caseTitle": "EMMANUEL ASHALLEY ASHLEY v THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ,THE GENER",
  "summary": "The appellant, Emmanuel Ashelly Ashley, was enrolled at the Middle Temple in 1959 and called to the English Bar in 1972. He served as a magistrate and later a Circuit Court Judge in Ghana from 1977 until his retirement in 1992, when it was determined he was not on the Roll of Lawyers in Ghana and lacked a university degree. He sought to challenge his exclusion from the Roll, arguing that his prior enrolment entitled him to accrued rights unaffected by the Legal Profession Act (Amendment) No. 2 Decree, 1967 (NLCD 213), which required a university degree for enrolment effective January 1, 1971. The Supreme Court held that mere enrolment in a law school does not create an irreversible right to practice law, and since the appellant qualified after the amendment took effect, he was bound by its requirements. His appeal was dismissed, affirming that Ghana has the sovereign right to set professional qualifications, including requiring a university degree and a course in customary law.",
