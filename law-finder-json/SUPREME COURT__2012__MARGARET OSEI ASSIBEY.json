  "caseTitle": "MARGARET OSEI ASSIBEY",
  "summary": "This civil appeal before the Supreme Court of Ghana involved Margaret Osei Assibey, the Appellant, seeking declaratory relief, recovery of possession, damages for trespass, and a perpetual injunction over H/No. 461, Kwadaso Estate, Kumasi, which she claimed belonged to her late husband, Mr. Samuel Kwame Kyei. She alleged he had paid Commander Godwin Edward Osei (the Respondent) to purchase the property on his behalf due to military rank restrictions. The Respondent, a senior government official, claimed he lawfully purchased the property from the State Housing Corporation with financing from Ghana Commercial Bank and allowed the Appellant and her family to occupy it temporarily. He later joined the suit and counterclaimed for title and possession. The High Court and Court of Appeal both ruled in favor of the Respondent. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, holding that Exhibit 'H'—a letter from the Respondent referencing a house for Mr. Kyei—was not a binding instrument under Section 25 of the Evidence Act because it was a unilateral communication to a third party lacking material property details. The court emphasized that the trial judge properly assessed credibility, noting inconsistencies in the Appellant’s evidence regarding the purchase sum and the implausibility of payments made after the house was already completed. The Appellant failed to provide corroborative evidence of payment or equitable ownership. The judgment reaffirmed that findings of fact by trial courts are entitled to deference on appeal, particularly on witness credibility and documentary interpretation.",
