  "summary": "This Court of Appeal case from Ghana involves a land dispute between John Eshun (plaintiff/respondent) and Oko Quartey and Nii Ayittey Agbofu II (defendants/appellants). The plaintiff claimed ejectment and damages for trespass over a plot allegedly licensed to him by the Ghana Railway Corporation. The defendants asserted customary ownership through a 24-year uninterrupted possession and a grant from the Ashong Kwaku family. The Court of Appeal found that the plaintiff failed to prove his licence predated the litigation, with key documents produced post-litigation. It held that as an exclusive licensee, the plaintiff lacked locus standi to sue in his own name, citing Heap v. Hartley. The trial court erred in placing the burden on the defendant to join the Railway Corporation and in failing to properly assess conflicting oral evidence. The appeal was allowed, the judgment set aside, and the plaintiff's claim dismissed due to lack of standing and insufficient evidence.",
