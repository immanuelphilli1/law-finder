  "caseTitle": "KOWUS MOTORS v CHECK POINT GH. LTD. 7 ORS",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana considered whether Kowus Motors, the plaintiff/appellant, had locus standi to bring an action after it had ceased to exist due to a statutory merger under the Transfer of Shares and Merger (Kowus Motors, Kaasbohrer Ghana Limited and Ghana Assembly Plant) Decree, 1979 (AFRCD 60). The decree merged Kowus Motors with other companies into Automotive and Technical Services Limited (ATS), thereby extinguishing its separate legal identity. The respondents argued that the action was a nullity because the plaintiff no longer existed as a legal entity at the time the suit was filed. The court reaffirmed the principle that an action brought by a non-existent legal person is a nullity, citing both local and English authorities. It held that since Kowus Motors had been dissolved by operation of law prior to the commencement of the action, it lacked capacity to sue, rendering the entire proceeding void ab initio.",
