  "caseTitle": "HOLDINGS LTD. v. GHANA COMMERCIAL BANK LTD",
  "summary": "The Court of Appeal of Ghana set aside the decision of the High Court which had allowed an originating summons filed by Naos Holdings Ltd. against Ghana Commercial Bank Ltd. The plaintiff sought a declaration of rights under five promissory notes it claimed to hold as a holder in due course, originally issued by Sabat Motors to Eaglet Corporation and later endorsed to the plaintiff. The defendant bank applied to strike out the proceedings, arguing that there were substantial factual disputes including lack of consideration, prior repudiation of the notes by Sabat Motors, and mala fides on the part of the plaintiff. The High Court ruled the originating summons appropriate but permitted the defendant to adduce documentary evidence on mala fides. The Court of Appeal held that the use of an originating summons was improper because the case involved complex and disputed facts—such as whether the notes were issued without consideration, whether they were repudiated before endorsement, and whether the plaintiff had notice of defects—that could not be adequately resolved by affidavit evidence alone and required viva voce testimony. Citing precedent, the court emphasized that originating summons are only suitable where the primary issue is one of legal construction and no serious factual dispute exists. Since the resolution of the case depended on contested facts, the proper procedure was an action by writ, not originating summons. The appeal was allowed, and the matter was remitted for determination through appropriate proceedings.",
