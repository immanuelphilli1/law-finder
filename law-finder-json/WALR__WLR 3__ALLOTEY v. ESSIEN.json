  "caseTitle": "ALLOTEY VERSUS ESSIEN",
  "summary": "In Allokey v. Essien, the plaintiff sought a declaration of title and recovery of possession of land occupied and developed by the defendant, who claimed ownership through purchase. The High Court, Eastern Judicial Division, found that the defendant had acted in good faith since 1947, constructing buildings and spending approximately £3,500 while the plaintiff's family remained aware of his actions but failed to object or intervene. The court held that under native custom and equity, the plaintiff's family was estopped by acquiescence and conduct from asserting title, particularly given their knowledge of prior litigation involving the same land in which they did not participate. Additionally, the plaintiff's attempt to introduce evidence contradicting her pleadings—specifically, claims of having issued oral and written warnings—was rejected due to failure to amend pleadings and produce the written notice. Judgment was entered for the defendant.",
