  "summary": "In this Court of Appeal decision, the appellant, Ghana Textile Printing Co. Ltd., challenged a High Court ruling that awarded severance pay to 100 former employees from the date each commenced employment up to 31st December 1990, based on claims that the collective agreement violated NLCD.342. The respondents, declared redundant in 1994, had been paid under a collective agreement providing two months’ basic pay per year of service from 1961. The trial court found the awards unlawful and ordered enhanced compensation. The Court of Appeal reversed, holding that paragraph 34(2) of NLCD.342 does not mandate a specific severance formula but only requires consideration of past service when determining diminution in employment terms. Thus, the collective agreement was valid. The court also rejected a preliminary objection to the appeal's admissibility, ruling that failure to file submissions under Rule 20(1) of C.I.125 does not automatically strike out an appeal. The appeal was allowed, and the trial court’s judgment set aside.",
