  "caseTitle": "JOSEPH NORTEY DOWUONA v. E. K. DOUDU",
  "summary": "This is an appeal from a civil property dispute between Joseph Nortey Dowuona, administrator of his late mother's estate, and E. K. Doudou, who occupied House No. B737/7 Abossey Okai, Accra. The plaintiff claimed the defendant was holding the property as security for a mortgage repayment agreement from 1968, set to end on 31st March 1975, after which the property should have been returned. The defendant counterclaimed, asserting he had a license to build and was promised ownership of the land upon full repayment. The trial court ruled for the plaintiff, finding the defendant's evidence inconsistent and lacking credibility, particularly due to his inability to recall key financial details and absence of documentation. The Court of Appeal upheld the decision, affirming that the trial judge properly evaluated conflicting evidence and reasonably concluded the plaintiff's account was more credible. The appeal was dismissed.",
