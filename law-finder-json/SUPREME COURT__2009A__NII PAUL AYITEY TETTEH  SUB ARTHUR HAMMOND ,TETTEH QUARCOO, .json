  "caseTitle": "NII PAUL AYITEY TETTEH SUB ARTHUR HAMMOND ,TETTEH QUARCOO,",
  "summary": "This consolidated civil appeal before the Supreme Court of Ghana arose from a dispute over the headship of the Onamrokor Adain Family of Accra. The plaintiff, Nii Paul Ayitey Tetteh (later substituted by Arthur Hammond), sued to declare his position as Head of Family since 1994, sought injunctions against B.A. Quarcoo and Jafro Mensah Larkai from claiming headship roles, and invoked judicial estoppel based on a 1980 Court of Appeal judgment that had destooled B.A. Quarcoo. The second suit, brought by B.A. Quarcoo and Larkai, sought to prevent the burial of Ayitey Tetteh as head of the family. The appellants argued that the first suit did not survive Ayitey Tetteh's death and that the consolidation was improper. The Supreme Court held that the action was representative of the family, not purely personal, and thus survived the plaintiff's death. It affirmed that the family, as a customary corporate entity, is distinct from its head and does not die with him. The Court rejected the appellants' claims due to lack of pleaded and proven evidence regarding traditional positions and locus standi, upheld the consolidation, and affirmed the right to bury Ayitey Tetteh as head. The appeal was dismissed.",
