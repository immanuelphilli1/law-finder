  "summary": "This civil appeal before the West African Court of Appeal involved two consolidated suits by Cudjoe Amuakwa, Chief of Duakwa, against Kwa Gurah and Kwa Amuquandoh Peyin for unpaid rent under a land agreement. The cases were initially heard on the undefended list, with both defendants denied leave to defend after filing affidavits disclosing no substantial defence. A subsequent review allowed evidence on whether the defendants understood the term 'acre' in the agreement, but the trial court upheld the judgment. On appeal, the Court affirmed the trial judge's factual findings that the defendants understood the agreement, which was negotiated over multiple meetings with the District Commissioner interpreting it clause by clause. The appellants' claim of misunderstanding was rejected, especially given the involvement of educated intermediaries ('scholars') and the use of 573 trees as equivalent to an acre. However, the appellate court varied the judgment, reducing the awarded amounts by one-third because only two years of rent were due at the time of filing, not three, and there was no provision for advance payment. Costs of the appeal were awarded to the respondent.",
