  "caseTitle": "THE ART OF WRITING JUDGMENT [1987-88] VOL. XVI RGL 36—41",
  "summary": "This 1987–88 address by Chief Justice Sowah E. N. P. to Ghanaian judges focuses on the principles and best practices for writing judicial judgments. Delivered during a period when the PNDC governed by proclamation following the suspension of the 1979 Constitution, the speech emphasizes the critical role of judgment writing in the administration of justice. The CJ underscores the importance of language proficiency, particularly in English, as the official court language, and advocates for clarity, brevity, and precision in judicial expression. He discusses the need for judges to settle issues early, evaluate evidence rigorously, apply binding precedents correctly, and avoid unnecessary verbosity or reliance on witness demeanor. The address also highlights systemic challenges, including lack of access to law reports and appellate decisions, and calls for improved legal infrastructure. The overall tone is instructional, aiming to elevate judicial standards across lower and superior courts in Ghana.",
