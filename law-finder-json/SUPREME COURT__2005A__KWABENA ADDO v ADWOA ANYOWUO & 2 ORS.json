  "summary": "The case of Kwabena Addo v Adwoa Anyowuo & 2 Ors involved a dispute over ownership of House No. C325/15 Alajo, Accra. The plaintiff claimed the property was gifted to him by his late uncle, S.K. Opoku, and that he financed its construction. The defendants, S.K. Opoku’s widow and daughters, counterclaimed that the house was self-acquired property of the deceased and passed to them upon his death. The High Court initially ruled for the defendants, but the Court of Appeal reversed the decision. The Supreme Court, noting missing records affecting the evidence, ultimately upheld the Court of Appeal’s judgment, emphasizing that the plaintiff proved his case on the strength of his own evidence, consistent with the standard of proof in land title cases. The court also addressed the applicability of PNDC Law 111 on intestate succession under matrilineal systems.",
