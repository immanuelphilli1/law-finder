  "caseTitle": "ANTHONY ABURIME v THE SECRETARY, ASSEMBLIES OF GOD MISSION",
  "summary": "The plaintiff brought a trespass action seeking damages, which the trial judge dismissed sua sponte on the grounds that the Supreme Court's jurisdiction was ousted under the proviso to section 12 of the Supreme Court Ordinance, as the matter allegedly involved title to land within the jurisdiction of a Native Court. The West African Court of Appeal held that the judge erred in dismissing the case without evidence or admission on two key points: (1) whether the suit raised an issue of title to land, and (2) whether a Native Court had jurisdiction over the land. The appellate court emphasized that jurisdiction cannot be ousted based on assumptions, and remitted the case for determination after proper evidentiary assessment.",
