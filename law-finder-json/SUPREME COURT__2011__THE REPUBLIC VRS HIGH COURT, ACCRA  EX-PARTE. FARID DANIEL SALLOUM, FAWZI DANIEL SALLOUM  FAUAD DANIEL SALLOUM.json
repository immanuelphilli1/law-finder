  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana considered an appeal against a High Court decision that set aside, ex parte, the execution of a writ of possession. The applicants, Farid Daniel Salloum and others, had obtained a judgment for ejectment and rent recovery against John Wilson Akoto (Jnr). During execution, Charles Senyo Coker, who was not a party to the original suit but claimed an interest in the property, applied ex parte to set aside the writ, citing a prior injunction and lack of service. The High Court granted the application without notifying the applicants. The Supreme Court held that the ex parte setting aside of execution violated the audi alteram partem principle, as the applicants were directly affected and no exceptional circumstances justified the lack of notice. It emphasized that suppression of material facts and denial of a fair hearing in execution proceedings constitutes a breach of natural justice, rendering the order a nullity. The Court quashed the High Court's decision, affirming that procedural rules cannot override fundamental constitutional rights.",
