  "caseTitle": "REX V MAMA TIMBUKTU",
  "summary": "In Rex v. Mama Timbuktu, the appellant was convicted of murder for killing Akwesi, who was assisting a native policeman in an unlawful arrest. The trial judge directed the jury that the offense could not be reduced to manslaughter, though he allowed consideration of justifiable homicide. The West African Court of Appeal held that the question of manslaughter should have been left to the jury, given the appellant's reasonable fear of being seized for sacrifice. Finding that the trial error likely affected the outcome, the Court substituted the murder conviction with a verdict of guilty of manslaughter under section 11(2) of the West African Court of Appeal Ordinance and sentenced the appellant to three years' imprisonment with hard labor from February 24, 1937.",
