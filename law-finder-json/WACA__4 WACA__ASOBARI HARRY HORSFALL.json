  "caseTitle": "ASOBARI HARRY HORSFALL",
  "summary": "This case, decided by the West Africa Court of Appeal on 10th January 1938, addressed whether a Magistrate's Court has jurisdiction to hear a land title suit transferred by a Resident under section 36(1)(b) of the Native Courts Ordinance, in light of section 32 of the Protectorate Courts Ordinance, 1933. The court held that when a Magistrate's Court re-hears a case pursuant to an order by a Resident exercising appellate jurisdiction, it is not acting in original jurisdiction. Therefore, the Magistrate's Court retains jurisdiction to hear the matter. The ruling clarified the interplay between native and protectorate court systems in colonial West Africa, affirming procedural continuity in appellate rehearings.",
