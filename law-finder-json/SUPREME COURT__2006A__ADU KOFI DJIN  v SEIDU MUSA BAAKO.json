  "summary": "In Adu Kofi Djin v Seidu Musa Baako, a land dispute in Ghana, the Supreme Court reviewed whether the defendant's counterclaim was statute-barred under the Limitation Decree 1972 (NRCD 54). The trial court had recognized the defendant's family's title but erroneously granted the plaintiff relief based on adverse possession, declaring the counterclaim statute-barred. The Court of Appeal reversed, favoring the defendant. The Supreme Court held that the trial judge erred in applying the Limitation Decree retroactively and in miscalculating the adverse possession period. It affirmed that the defendant, as administrator of his father's estate, had capacity to sue. The court found that the plaintiff's claim derived from a void grant due to lack of proprietary right by the grantors, rendering the plaintiff's title invalid. The defendant’s counterclaim was not statute-barred, as the limitation period did not run from 1966, and the plaintiff failed to prove uninterrupted adverse possession. The appeal was dismissed, upholding the defendant's title and counterclaim.",
