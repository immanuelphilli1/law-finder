  "caseTitle": "REX. VERSUS KWAME DARKO",
  "summary": "The appellants, Kwame Darko and Kwesi Otu Darko, were initially convicted of the murder of Yerima Kotokoli and Mama Kotokoli. The West African Court of Appeal, considering a report from the trial judge indicating a potential miscarriage of justice and noting serious inconsistencies in the Crown's evidence, substituted the murder verdicts with manslaughter. The court emphasized the existence of the Crown's common law right to 'stand by' jurors, despite silence in the Criminal Procedure Ordinance. Additionally, a motion by local chiefs during the trial likely influenced the jury, contributing to an unfair atmosphere. The appellants were sentenced to three and four years' imprisonment respectively, with hard labour, to run concurrently from the date of original conviction.",
