  "caseTitle": "NICHOLAS CHARLES AGBEVOR v. THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL",
  "summary": "In Nicholas Charles Agbevor v. The Attorney-General (Supreme Court, 2000), the plaintiff, a 2nd Deputy Judicial Secretary, challenged his removal from the Judicial Service by the President based on alleged incompetence. The Supreme Court held that the President's action violated Articles 151 and 127 of the 1992 Constitution, which vest exclusive authority to remove judicial officers in the Chief Justice following due process and safeguard judicial independence. The Court ruled that the plaintiff qualified as a judicial officer under Article 161(b), and thus his removal by the President was unconstitutional. The Court further criticized the Judicial Council for improperly recommending the removal, breaching its constitutional duty to protect judicial independence.",
