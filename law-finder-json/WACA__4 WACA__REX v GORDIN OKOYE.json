  "summary": "In Rex v Gordin Okoye, the West Africa Court of Appeal allowed an appeal against a conviction for perjury under section 118 of the Criminal Code. The appellant had been convicted by the High Court of the Enugu-Onitsha Division and sentenced to six months of hard labour. The appellate court found the conviction unsustainable due to insufficient evidence. First, the alleged perjurious testimony was not clearly set out in the particulars, and the certified record of proceedings did not definitively corroborate that the appellant made the statements in question. Second, the evidence offered to prove the falsity of the statements was inadequate: no witness testified from personal knowledge, and reliance on a Native Court record and co-witnesses' prior testimony amounted to inadmissible hearsay regarding the truth of the statements. The court emphasized that such records are admissible only for proving that statements were made, not their veracity. Consequently, the conviction and sentence were quashed, and an acquittal was entered.",
