  "caseTitle": "EBU VERSUS ABABIO.",
  "summary": "In EBU v. ABABIO, a land title dispute between two stools in the Gold Coast (now Ghana), the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council upheld a declaration of title in favor of the plaintiff stool based on long and continuous possession, despite inconclusive traditional evidence regarding first occupation. The plaintiff demonstrated acts of ownership, including granting concessions as early as 1907 and exercising control over villages on the land. Although the traditional evidence did not clearly establish original occupancy, the trial judge and appellate court found the plaintiff's evidence of possession credible and sufficient to support title. The Privy Council affirmed that a favorable finding on traditional evidence is not mandatory when possession is well-documented and extensive. The appeal was dismissed, with costs awarded to the respondent.",
