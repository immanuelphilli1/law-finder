  "caseTitle": "REX V RUJO BODOM",
  "summary": "In Rex v Rujo Bodom (1935, WACA/2), four appellants were convicted of murder at the Assizes in Kumasi based partly on confessions and admissions obtained after they had been severely beaten and tied up in their village to extract confessions. The West Africa Court of Appeal quashed the convictions, holding that the confessions were inadmissible because they were induced by violence and influence from a person in authority. Additionally, the court found that the trial judge misdirected the assessors by failing to clarify that each confession was only evidence against the individual who made it, not against co-accused. The court also condemned the police practice of taking accused persons back to the crime scene to obtain admissions, deeming it contrary to fundamental principles of justice. The appeal was allowed and the convictions set aside.",
