  "caseTitle": "ANSAH VERSUS SACKEY.",
  "summary": "In Ansa v. Sackey, the High Court of Ghana's Eastern Judicial Division held that the plaintiff retained a valid usufructuary interest in Asere Stool land despite a subsequent grant to the defendant. The court found that under native custom, a stool cannot forfeit land granted for building purposes without first giving the grantee notice and a reasonable opportunity to remedy the breach. The evidence showed no such notice or opportunity was given, rendering the alleged forfeiture invalid. Consequently, the defendant's entry onto the land constituted trespass. The court declared the plaintiff the rightful holder of the usufruct and awarded damages of £25.",
