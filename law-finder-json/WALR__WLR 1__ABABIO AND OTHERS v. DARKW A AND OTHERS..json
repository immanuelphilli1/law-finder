  "caseTitle": "AND OTHERS VERSUS DARKW A AND OTHERS.",
  "summary": "In Ababio and Others v. Darkwa and Others, the plaintiffs claimed title to a tract of forest land allegedly purchased from the Akanteng Stool in 1913, with a deed of conveyance executed in 1927. The deed was signed by the Odikro of Akanteng as vendor and the Omanhene of Akyem Abuakwa as consenting party. The defendants, in possession as tenants of the Asamankese Stool, contested the sale, asserting the land belonged to the Asamankese Stool and that Akanteng lacked authority to sell it. The court held that under native customary law, a valid transfer of forest land required public demarcation and customary rites such as the 'Cutting of Guaha,' which were absent. The land was found to be Asamankese Stool land, and the Akanteng Stool had no power to alienate it. The consent of the paramount stool (Akyem Abuakwa) was not necessary for such alienation. The plaintiffs failed to prove a valid conveyance or ownership, and the appeal was dismissed with judgment entered for the defendants.",
