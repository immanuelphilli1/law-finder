  "summary": "The appellants, Momodu Layoye and Oje Akanbi, were convicted in the High Court of Ibadan for the murder of an unknown woman found near Lunku. The prosecution's case relied on testimony from police and witnesses who described the body with multiple wounds, and a post-mortem by Dr. Dale, who confirmed fatal head injuries. However, no link was established between the body examined by the doctor and the one found at the scene. The West Africa Court of Appeal held that this failure to identify the body was fatal to the conviction, as it undermined the medical evidence necessary to prove death by violence. Other issues included inadequate police investigation, inconsistent testimony about mutilation, uncorroborated confessions, and improperly admitted evidence such as a cloth and club found later without reliable provenance. Additionally, the prosecution failed to affirmatively prove that the second appellant's wife, called as a witness, was not in a monogamous marriage, despite her being sworn on the Koran. The court emphasized that even if courtroom conduct suggested an admission, the prosecution must still meet its burden of proof. Consequently, the convictions were quashed.",
