  "caseTitle": "KWABENA AGYAPONG v. YAW MENSAH",
  "summary": "This is a land title dispute between Kwabena Agyapong (plaintiff/appellant) and Yaw Mensah (defendant/respondent) over Plot No. 1A Block J, Kentinkronu, Kumasi. The plaintiff claimed ownership through a 1981 deed of assignment from Prince Albert Prempeh, who allegedly leased the land from the Akyempim Stool in 1976. However, the Court of Appeal found inconsistencies between the plaintiff's pleadings and evidence, noting he failed to prove the root of title or call key witnesses. The defendant, representing the Aburam family, established a customary usufructuary interest through a 1907 purchase by his ancestor, Yaw Bonda, from Oheneba Kwaku Duah, then Akyempimhene. The court held that the Akyempim Stool could not validly lease the land without the family's consent, rendering the plaintiff's title void. The trial court's judgment in favor of the defendant was upheld.",
