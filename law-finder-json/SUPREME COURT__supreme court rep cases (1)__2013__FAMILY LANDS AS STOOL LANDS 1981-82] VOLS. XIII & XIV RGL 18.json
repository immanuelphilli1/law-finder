  "summary": "In Okwan v. Amankwa, the court addressed whether family land falls under the statutory definition of 'stool land' subject to state control under the Administration of Lands Act, 1962. The plaintiff sued for accounts of moneys collected from stool family lands, and the defendants challenged the plaintiff's standing, citing state control over stool land revenues. The court upheld the plaintiff's position, distinguishing between 'public stools' and 'family stools', and held that family land is not 'stool land' under the Act. This distinction was supported by prior case law. Subsequent constitutional changes in 1969, 1979, and 1982 expanded the definition of 'stool land' to include land controlled by a family for its members, raising concerns about state overreach. The commentary questions whether this expansion was intended to bring all family lands under state control, noting that such an interpretation would be impractical and contrary to customary law. It suggests that 'family' in the statutory definition should be interpreted as a broader community, not a single kinship group, to maintain consistency with traditional distinctions.",
