  "caseTitle": "INTERLOCUTORY MATTERS VERSUS INTRODUCTION",
  "summary": "This judicial commentary by Osei-Hwere P addresses interlocutory matters in Ghanaian civil procedure, emphasizing the responsible exercise of judicial discretion. It explores procedural issues such as renewal of writs, substituted service, and interim injunctions, highlighting the need for judges to consider social consequences, especially in high-profile contexts like football league disputes. The author critiques the lack of formal judicial training and advocates for structured education. Legal principles from English and Ghanaian cases are cited to illustrate when discretion should be applied, particularly in extending limitation periods or allowing procedural relaxations. The commentary also reviews appellate standards for reviewing discretionary orders and calls for modernizing Ghana's limitation laws to align with more equitable frameworks like the UK's Limitation Act 1975 s 2D.",
