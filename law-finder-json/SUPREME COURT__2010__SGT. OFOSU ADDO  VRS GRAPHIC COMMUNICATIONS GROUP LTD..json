  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision in SGT. OFOSU ADDO v. GRAPHIC COMMUNICATIONS GROUP LTD. (Civil Appeal No. J4/45/2010, decided 8th December 2010) concerned an appeal against the Court of Appeal's grant of a stay of execution of a High Court judgment for defamation. The plaintiff had won damages and a retraction order, but the defendant appealed and successfully obtained a stay of execution from the Court of Appeal. The plaintiff then appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that the stay was improperly granted. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, affirming that the Court of Appeal had the independent jurisdiction under Rule 28 of the Court of Appeal Rules to review the refused stay application. It held that the appellate court properly exercised its discretion to prevent potential injustice, such as the plaintiff being forced to publish a retraction only to win on appeal. Procedural irregularities in the affidavit were deemed waived, and the claim that new defenses were improperly introduced was dismissed due to lack of supporting evidence in the record. The Court emphasized the importance of preserving the integrity of the appellate process.",
