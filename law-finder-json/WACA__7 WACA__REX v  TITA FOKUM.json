  "caseTitle": "REX v TITA FOKUM",
  "summary": "This case involved an appeal from the High Court of the Calabar-Aba Judicial Division, where the appellant, Tita Fokum, was convicted following an order of transfer issued by a District Officer after the Native Court had already convicted and sentenced him. The West Africa Court of Appeal held that under the amended Native Courts Ordinance (No. 8 of 1938), such transfer orders could no longer be made after judgment or sentence. Since the transfer order was made on 17th October 1940—after the amendment— it was invalid. Consequently, the Court ruled that the High Court lacked jurisdiction, rendering all subsequent proceedings a nullity. The appeal was allowed, the conviction was quashed, and an order was made for the refund of the fine paid by the appellant.",
