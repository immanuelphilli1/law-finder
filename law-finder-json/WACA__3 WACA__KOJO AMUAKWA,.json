  "summary": "The West Africa Court of Appeal quashed the murder conviction of Kojo Amuakwa, Ohene of Agona Duakwa, who had shot and killed Eteng Usani during a riot in Ugep on 31 December 1935. The appellant's nearly completed house was being destroyed by rioters from a rival quarter, despite his non-involvement in the initial conflict. After removing some belongings, he returned and fired into a crowd attacking his property, intending only to scare them. The Assistant Judge found no prior intent to kill and acknowledged high provocation, but upheld the murder conviction. The appellate court ruled that the killing was justifiable under common law as it occurred during a felonious attack on his property—specifically, the unlawful destruction of a building under Sections 76 and 77 of the Criminal Code. Citing Russell on Crimes and Archbold, the court affirmed that one may use lethal force to defend their habitation against forcible dispossession without retreating. As the appellant was acting to repel felons destroying his home, the homicide was deemed justifiable, warranting acquittal.",
