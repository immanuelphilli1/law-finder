  "summary": "In Barclays (GH) Limited v. General Development Co., the Court of Appeal upheld a summary judgment granted by the High Court in favor of Barclays (GH) Limited, a creditor, against General Development Co., which defaulted on loan repayments totaling ₵5,154,243,371.48. The defendant entered a conditional appearance but failed to take further steps or oppose the plaintiff’s Order 14 summons for summary judgment, despite proper service. The court found no evidence of a triable defence and affirmed that the plaintiff had sufficiently proved its claim through attached documents, including the debenture deed and mortgage. The appeal, based on alleged non-production of documents, was dismissed as the notice to produce was never served, and the defendant’s inaction constituted negligence and lack of good faith. The judgment emphasized that courts will not assist indolent parties who ignore legal processes.",
