  "caseTitle": "SEMINAR ON THE TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS THE MECHANICS OF SENTE",
  "summary": "This 1989–90 seminar paper by Nyavor Eric analyzes the mechanics of sentencing in Ghana, particularly under the Public Tribunals established by PNDCL 24 and later PNDCL 78. It outlines three dominant theories of punishment—retributive, deterrent/preventive, and reformative—and observes that Ghanaian tribunals and courts predominantly applied retributive and deterrent approaches, especially for serious economic and drug-related offenses. The paper highlights the wide sentencing discretion granted to Public Tribunals, including the power to impose death sentences, minimum three-year imprisonment terms, communal labor, and forfeiture of illicitly acquired property. Special circumstances allow for reduced sentences under Section 16(3) of PNDCL 78. However, the analysis criticizes the overreliance on custodial sentences, leading to severe prison overcrowding (e.g., Sunyani Prison holding 669 inmates in a 400-capacity facility). It further notes that prisons have failed as reform institutions and instead function as criminal networks. Examples include a high-profile 'banker-to-banker' case where deterrence backfired, and prison officers smuggling contraband. The author calls for a dynamic, socially responsive sentencing policy that balances justice with rehabilitation.",
