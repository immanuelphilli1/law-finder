  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana addressed the interpretation of constitutional provisions on dual citizenship, emphasizing the purposive approach to statutory construction. The court examined the constitutional and legislative framework, particularly Article 8(2) of the 1992 Constitution and Section 16(2) of the Citizenship Act, 2000 (Act 591), which restrict dual citizens from holding certain public offices. The plaintiff, Professor Stephen Kwaku Asare, challenged these restrictions as violating constitutional rights to equality and non-discrimination. The court considered the historical and policy context, including the Committee of Experts' recommendations, which acknowledged both the economic benefits of dual citizenship and concerns over divided allegiance. It held that citizenship provisions are sui generis and must be interpreted within their specific constitutional context, not solely through general human rights principles. The court upheld the restrictions as constitutionally valid, balancing national interest in allegiance with the recognition of dual citizenship, and affirmed that such limitations do not violate entrenched constitutional rights when properly justified.",
