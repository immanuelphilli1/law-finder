  "caseTitle": "THOMAS HUTTON-MILLS 2",
  "summary": "This 1940 West Africa Court of Appeal decision addressed a post-judgment application concerning the repayment of excess amounts paid under a reversed lower court judgment. The original Divisional Court had awarded the plaintiff-respondent £1,644 10s. and costs of £73 18s. 6d. On appeal, the Court reduced the award to £250 and set aside the costs order. The defendants-appellants sought repayment of the difference (£1,394 10s.) plus interest and costs, which the lower court refused due to lack of authorization in the formal certificate. The appellate court held it possessed inherent power to make consequential orders, citing Evans v. Main Colliery Co. Ltd., and ordered repayment of the overpaid sum including costs, with interest at 4% per annum from the date of the order, rejecting interest from the original payment date but affirming the defendants' entitlement to restitution.",
