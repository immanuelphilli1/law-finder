  "caseTitle": "OWUSU KYENKYENHENE v. J. K. ADU",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana allowed an appeal challenging the Court of Appeal's affirmation of a High Court order that awarded the appellant GHS 8,000,000 as his share of jointly owned school assets without a prior professional valuation. The parties had co-owned the Minnesota International School under a partnership agreement requiring equal sharing of assets upon dissolution. The High Court had originally ordered a professional valuation by competent experts, but none was conducted. Instead, the court relied on an inventory and financial statements that did not constitute proper valuations. The Supreme Court found the monetary award arbitrary and capricious, lacking evidentiary support, and held that the Court of Appeal erred in failing to scrutinize the record. The case was remitted to the trial court for a professional valuation to ensure fair and equitable distribution of assets in accordance with the original court order.",
