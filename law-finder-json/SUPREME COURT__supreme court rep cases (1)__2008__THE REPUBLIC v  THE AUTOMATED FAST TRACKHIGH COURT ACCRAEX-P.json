  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC v THE AUTOMATED FAST TRACKHIGH COURT ACCRAEX-P",
  "summary": "The Republic applied to the Supreme Court of Ghana for certiorari and prohibition orders to quash the rulings and proceedings of the Automated Fast Track High Court, Accra, presided over by Justice Gyeasayor, in Suit No. AL 109/06. The applicant challenged the court’s jurisdiction, alleging the transfer of the case to Justice Gyeasayor was clandestine and irregular. The Supreme Court dismissed the application as time-barred under Rule 62 of the Supreme Court Rules, C.I. 16 (as amended), which requires such applications to be filed within 90 days of the grounds arising. The court held the cause of action arose on 26th October 2006, when Justice Gyeasayor first exercised jurisdiction by granting default judgment, not in March 2008 when he refused to set aside proceedings. Despite arguments invoking interest of justice, the court found no basis to excuse the delay. The application was therefore dismissed.",
