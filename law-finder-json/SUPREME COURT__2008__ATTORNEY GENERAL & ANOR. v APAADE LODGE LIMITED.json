  "caseTitle": "ATTORNEY GENERAL & ANOR. v APAADE LODGE LIMITED",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed a repeat application by Apaade Lodge Limited for a stay of execution of a High Court default judgment dated 4 April 2006. The applicant had failed to appeal against the judgment but sought relief under the Court's inherent jurisdiction under Article 129(4) of the 1992 Constitution, arguing that justice required a stay pending appeal against a later Court of Appeal decision. The Court held that it could only exercise such powers when a matter is already within its jurisdiction, and since no appeal had been filed against the High Court judgment, it lacked jurisdiction to grant a stay. It reaffirmed that procedural rules under the Supreme Court Rules (C.I. 16), particularly Rule 20, require an appeal to be lodged before a stay application can be entertained. The Court also clarified that while default judgments are typically challenged by application to set aside, an appeal is still a legitimate remedy. The application was dismissed for non-compliance with procedural requirements.",
