  "caseTitle": "EMMANUEL ASHALLEY ASHLEY v THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ,THE GENER",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana dismissed the appeal of Emmanuel Ashelly Ashley, a former Circuit Court Judge, who challenged his retirement on the grounds that he lacked a university degree and was not enrolled on the Roll of Lawyers in Ghana. The court held that the Legal Profession Act (Amendment) No. 2 Decree, 1967 (NLCD 213), which required a university degree for enrolment effective January 1, 1971, applied to the appellant, who was called to the English Bar in 1972. His enrolment in the Middle Temple in 1959 did not confer accrued rights exempting him from the new requirements. The court rejected claims of discrimination and estoppel, affirming that professional qualifications are subject to national legislative standards and that mere enrolment in a foreign law school does not guarantee automatic recognition in Ghana.",
