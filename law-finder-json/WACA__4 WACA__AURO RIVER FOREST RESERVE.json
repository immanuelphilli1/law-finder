  "caseTitle": "IN THE MATTER OF THE AURO RIVER FOREST RESERVE AND THE CLAIMS OF",
  "summary": "This 1938 West Africa Court of Appeal decision addressed appeals concerning lump sum assessments for rights commuted in the Auro River Forest Reserve, Ghana. The original Reserve Settlement Commissioner, William Hugh Beeton, had rejected claims under section 11(1) of the Forests Ordinance. The appellants successfully appealed, leading the Court to remit the claims for assessment. However, before completion, Beeton was replaced by Henry Christopher Ellershaw, who conducted hearings and issued assessments without submitting them to the Governor for approval as required. The Court held that the 1936 appellate judgment had set aside Beeton’s original decision entirely, necessitating a new final judgment under section 13. Since Ellershaw’s assessments were not finalized via gubernatorial approval and no complete judgment was issued, the subsequent appeals were premature and invalid. The Court struck out the appeals, ordered refunds of fees, and in obiter dictum emphasized that either the original commissioner should complete the assessment or a new one must rehear the entire matter to ensure procedural integrity.",
