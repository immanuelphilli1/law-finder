  "caseTitle": "ELIZABETH A. MOMO v. ANANSE ANNANG (SUB. BY MICHAEL",
  "summary": "This Court of Appeal case in Ghana involved a land dispute between Madam Elizabeth A. Momo (appellant) and Ananse Annang (respondent, substituted by Michael Annang and another). Both parties claimed ownership of the same land through their late grandfathers. The appellant sought a declaration of title, damages for trespass, and a perpetual injunction, but failed to properly describe the land in her pleadings, relying instead on an attached plan. She claimed a prior arbitration had awarded the land to her family, but failed to prove the essential elements of a valid arbitration, including voluntary submission and agreement to be bound. The court found no credible evidence of such arbitration. Additionally, the appellant did not call boundary witnesses, and her survey plan did not match the physical land she claimed. Her documentary evidence (Exh B) indicated a leasehold grant inconsistent with her claim of customary inheritance. The court upheld the trial judge's dismissal of her claim, affirming that the respondents had established possessory title through undisturbed possession since 1965, with the disputed land falling within their claimed area. The respondents were granted a declaration of title, minimal damages for trespass, and a permanent injunction, except against those already in possession through the appellant.",
