  "summary": "The Union Trading Company Limited (Plaintiffs-Appellants) sued Walter Hauri (Defendant-Respondent), a former employee, for breach of a post-employment agreement restricting competition and association with a rival business. The agreement, signed in Switzerland on 8th November 1938, was made after the plaintiffs withheld Hauri's earned salary of 4,475.20 Swiss francs. The plaintiffs claimed this payment constituted consideration for Hauri's promise not to compete or assist a former colleague. The trial court and the West Africa Court of Appeal held that the agreement was unenforceable due to lack of valid consideration, as the money paid was already owed under the original employment contract. The court found that the plaintiffs withheld the salary not due to a genuine dispute but to coerce Hauri into signing the restrictive agreement. The alleged breaches of the original contract were either unproven or condoned by the employer's continued employment of Hauri. The court also rejected the argument that the agreement represented a compromise of a bona fide arbitration claim, noting the plaintiffs failed to present evidence of an honest belief in their defence. Consequently, the appeal was dismissed, and the injunction and damages were denied.",
