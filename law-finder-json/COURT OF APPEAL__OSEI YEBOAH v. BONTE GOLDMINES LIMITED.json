  "summary": "This Court of Appeal decision in Osei Yeboah v. Bonte Goldmines Limited (CA No. 82/99, 10 February 2000) centered on a land dispute involving a farmer's claim for trespass and compensation after the mining company destroyed 4,000 teak trees on his land. The trial court dismissed the trespass claim, recognizing the company's legal mining rights under PNDCL 153, but awarded GHS 2.6 million in compensation. On appeal, the key issue was whether the Land Valuation Board had exclusive authority to determine compensation under Section 71 of PNDCL 153. The appellate court held that the statute does not oust judicial jurisdiction, especially where the Board compromised its impartiality by advising the company against paying compensation, thereby rendering it unable to mediate fairly. The court affirmed the trial court's award, emphasizing that natural justice required judicial intervention when statutory mechanisms fail due to bias or procedural breakdown.",
