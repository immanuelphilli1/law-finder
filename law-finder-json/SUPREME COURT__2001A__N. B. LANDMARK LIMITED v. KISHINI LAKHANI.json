  "caseTitle": "N. B. LANDMARK LIMITED v. KISHINI LAKHANI",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana allowed an appeal challenging the Court of Appeal's grant of a stay of execution regarding a Circuit Court decision that refused to set aside a default judgment. The Supreme Court held that a refusal to set aside a default judgment is not executable and therefore cannot be subject to a stay of execution. The Court emphasized that the Court of Appeal erred by focusing on the substantive judgment of 2nd November 1998, which was not the subject of the appeal or the stay application. Consequently, the Supreme Court set aside the Court of Appeal’s ruling dated 24th March 1999.",
