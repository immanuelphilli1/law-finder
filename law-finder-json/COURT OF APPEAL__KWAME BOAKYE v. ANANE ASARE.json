  "caseTitle": "BOAKYE v. ANANE ASARE",
  "summary": "This Court of Appeal case involves Kwame Boakye (respondent) and Anane Asare (appellant), concerning a land dispute where the parties reached an arbitration-based settlement during a pending appeal. Despite agreeing to discontinue the appeal, Asare proceeded without informing the court or Boakye, obtained a favorable judgment, and later harvested Boakye’s crops. The trial court found fraud but declined to set aside the appellate judgment, citing precedent requiring fraud directly on the court. The Court of Appeal reversed, holding that non-disclosure of the compromise constituted fraud on both the opposing party and the court, warranting setting aside the original appellate decision under principles from Barclays Bank DCO v Heward-Mills (1964 GLR 332). The appeal was allowed, emphasizing public policy favoring dispute settlement and judicial integrity.",
