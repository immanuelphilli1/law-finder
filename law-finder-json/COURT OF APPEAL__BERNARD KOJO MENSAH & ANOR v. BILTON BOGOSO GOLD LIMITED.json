  "caseTitle": "BERNARD KOJO MENSAH & ANOR v. BILTON BOGOSO GOLD LIMITED",
  "summary": "The Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's finding that Bernard Kojo Mensah and another were employees of Bilton Bogoso Gold Limited under a contract of service, not independent contractors of Emanet Services. Despite the absence of formal appointment letters, the court relied on documentary evidence including a testimonial (Exh. G), payroll records (Exh. A), and a dismissal letter (Exh. B) to confirm the employment relationship. Applying the Ready Mixed Concrete test, the court found that the appellants exercised control over the respondents, remunerated them directly, and subjected them to company rules. The dismissal was ruled wrongful because the company failed to justify the termination or allow the respondents to respond to allegations of negligence. The appeal was dismissed, affirming the award of damages for wrongful dismissal.",
