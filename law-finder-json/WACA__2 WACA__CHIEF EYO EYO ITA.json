  "summary": "This 1935 West Africa Court of Appeal decision involved a civil claim by Chief Eyo Eyo Ita and members of the King Eyo III House of Creek Town against Etubom Okon Efa Asido and others for property damage arising from a riot. The plaintiffs sought ₤1,935 11s. 11d in special damages, but the High Court dismissed the claim, finding the evidence unreliable. The central issue on appeal was whether certified copies of criminal convictions related to the same acts should have been admitted as presumptive proof of liability in the civil suit. The appellate court held that such convictions are admissible not only to prove the fact of conviction but also as presumptive evidence of the commission of the underlying criminal acts, citing Re Crippen (1911) and Mash v. Darley (1914). Since the trial judge had excluded this evidence—relying on outdated legal authority—the Court of Appeal ruled that a miscarriage of justice had occurred and remitted the case for retrial.",
