  "caseTitle": "G. D. LARYEA",
  "summary": "This 1940 West Africa Court of Appeal decision involved a land dispute in Accra, Ghana, where the plaintiff-appellant sought a declaration of title and damages for trespass against the defendant-respondent. The trial judge non-suited the plaintiff for failing to meet the burden of proof regarding title and possession, and denied the defendant costs, citing lack of merit on either side and the defendant's absence. The appellate court held that the trial judge improperly exercised discretion in denying costs, as the defendant's success did not require affirmative merit, and absence was not a valid reason for cost denial. The appeal was dismissed, costs of appeal were awarded to the defendant, and the lower court's judgment was varied to include costs for the defendant in the court below. The appellate judges also criticized the trial judge's broad negative characterization of Accra residents as unjustified and inappropriate.",
