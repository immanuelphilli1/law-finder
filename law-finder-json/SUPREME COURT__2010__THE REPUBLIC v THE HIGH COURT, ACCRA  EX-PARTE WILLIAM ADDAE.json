  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC v THE HIGH COURT, ACCRA EX-PARTE WILLIAM ADDAE",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana considered an application by four Assembly members from the Biakoye District seeking certiorari and prohibition to quash an interlocutory injunction issued by the High Court, Accra, which restrained the inauguration and operation of the Biakoye District Assembly. The Applicants were not parties to the original suit but claimed the injunction prevented them from discharging their duties. They argued that the High Court lacked jurisdiction under Article 130(1)(b) of the 1992 Constitution to invalidate legislation, a power reserved for the Supreme Court. A preliminary objection was raised that the application was filed out of time under Rule 62 of CI 16, which requires filing within 90 days. However, the Court held that the cause of action arose on May 13, 2009, when a new injunction directly affecting the Applicants was issued, not in March 2008, making the application timely. The Court found no proof that the Applicants had been served with earlier orders and thus dismissed the preliminary objection. The ruling affirmed the Supreme Court's exclusive supervisory jurisdiction over constitutional challenges to legislative instruments.",
