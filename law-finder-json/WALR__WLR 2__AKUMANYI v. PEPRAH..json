  "caseTitle": "AKUMANYI VERSUS PEPRAH.",
  "summary": "This 1956 Gold Coast Supreme Court decision in Akumanyi v. Peprah concerned a dispute between two nephews over succession to a deceased intestate. The plaintiff claimed valid appointment by the family and confirmation by the family head, seeking a declaration to that effect. The defendant contested the authority of the appointing individual and asserted res judicata based on two customary arbitrations. The Native Court upheld the plaintiff's appointment under native law and custom, finding the arbitrations did not bar the suit. On appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed, holding that (i) under local custom, the son of the elder sister takes precedence over the son of the younger sister regardless of personal age; (ii) the family possesses discretionary power to appoint a successor even over someone with prior customary claim; and (iii) for customary arbitration to constitute res judicata, it must be valid, involve the same parties, and resolve substantially identical issues—conditions not met here due to insufficient proof and discrepancies in testimony.",
