  "caseTitle": "JOOF VERSUS GAMBIAN MINERALS LTD.",
  "summary": "In Joof v. Gambia Minerals Ltd., the plaintiff, a carpenter, suffered severe hand injuries from a circular saw at work due to the absence of a safety guard, resulting in the amputation of three fingers and 42.5% disability. The defendant admitted negligence but raised two defenses: contributory negligence and prior compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Ordinance, c. 93, s. 25(1)(b), which they argued barred the common law claim. The court rejected the statutory bar defense because the prior 'judgment' was issued against the company's manager, not the employer entity itself, and procedural rules under the Ordinance were not followed. On merits, the court found the plaintiff 25% contributorily negligent under the Laws of England (Application) Ordinance, c. 1, s. 11, reducing general damages from £1,600 to £1,200. Special damages amounted to £107 14s. The decision affirms strict compliance with statutory procedures and allows common law claims where procedural defects invalidate prior compensation proceedings.",
