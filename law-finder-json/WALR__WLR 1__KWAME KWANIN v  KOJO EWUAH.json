  "caseTitle": "KWAME KWANIN v KOJO EWUAH",
  "summary": "This civil appeal before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council concerned a land dispute between two stools in the Gold Coast (now Ghana) over an area of approximately 56 square miles. The appellant, Chief Kwame Kwanin (Obuasi Stool), challenged the Court of Appeal's confirmation of a declaration of title in favor of the respondent, Chief Kojo Ewuah (Nyinawusu Stool), along with damages and an injunction. The Privy Council dismissed the appeal, upholding concurrent findings of fact by the lower courts that the respondent had established title through traditional evidence, effective occupation, and collection of tributes. Two main legal issues were considered: (1) whether a 1917 Native Tribunal judgment created an estoppel; the Privy Council found the land description too vague to support estoppel; and (2) whether the trial was procedurally defective because the assessor’s opinion was not delivered orally in open court. The Council held that no defect was proven on record, noting the absence of a statutory requirement for oral delivery, though it suggested future procedural clarification. The appeal was dismissed.",
