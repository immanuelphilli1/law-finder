  "caseTitle": "SEMINAR ON THE TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS THE MECHANICS OF SENTE",
  "summary": "This academic paper presented at a seminar discusses the mechanics of sentencing in Ghana, focusing on the role of public tribunals established under PNDCL 78. It outlines the three main theories of punishment—retributive, deterrent/preventive, and reformative—and critiques how judicial discretion is exercised in practice. The author notes that while tribunals have wide sentencing powers, including the death penalty and mandatory minimum sentences, they often rely on deterrence, especially for economic and drug-related crimes. However, this approach has led to prison overcrowding and ineffective rehabilitation. The paper highlights inconsistencies in sentencing, including personal biases of judicial officers and the misuse of custodial sentences, particularly for juveniles. It calls for a more balanced, dynamic sentencing policy that considers social context and reform, rather than mere punishment.",
