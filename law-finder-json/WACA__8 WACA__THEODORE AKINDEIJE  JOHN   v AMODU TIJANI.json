  "caseTitle": "THEODORE AKINDEIJE JOHN v AMODU TIJANI",
  "summary": "This West African Court of Appeal decision resolves a procedural conflict regarding interpleader claims under Order 45 rule 25 of the Supreme Court Rules. The case arose when a claimant (plaintiff) sought release of land attached under a writ of Fi Fa, having proved possession. The core issue was whether the judgment creditor (defendant) could introduce evidence that the judgment debtor held superior title to the land. The Court held that Order 45 rule 25 is designed to protect possessory interests, and unless the judgment creditor properly pleads that the claimant holds the property in trust for, or pays rent to, the debtor, evidence of the debtor's title is inadmissible. The Court criticized the prevailing practice of treating such claims as separate suits, emphasizing that claims should be adjudicated within the original suit to ensure the judgment debtor remains a party. On the pleadings, which did not allege trust or rent, the defendant could not prove the debtor's title, and the claimant was entitled to release of the property.",
