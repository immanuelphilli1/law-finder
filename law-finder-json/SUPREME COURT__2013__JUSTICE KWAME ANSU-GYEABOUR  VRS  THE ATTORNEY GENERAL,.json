  "caseTitle": "JUSTICE KWAME ANSU-GYEABOUR VRS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL,",
  "summary": "This is a constitutional reference brought by Justice Kwame Ansu-Gyeabour to the Supreme Court of Ghana under Article 130(2) of the 1992 Constitution, seeking clarification on the procedures for judicial impeachment. The plaintiff challenged the legality of investigative committees (Ansah, Akuffo, and Adinyira) formed in response to corruption allegations, arguing that the Chief Justice failed to personally determine a prima facie case as required under Article 146(3), rendering subsequent actions unconstitutional. He also contended that the Judicial Council lacked authority to petition the President for his removal and that he was denied procedural fairness. The Supreme Court was tasked with interpreting key constitutional provisions regarding the non-delegable nature of the Chief Justice's duty, the proper impeachment process, and the limits of the Judicial Council's powers to ensure the security of judicial tenure.",
