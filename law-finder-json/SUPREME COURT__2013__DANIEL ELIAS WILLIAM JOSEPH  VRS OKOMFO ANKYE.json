  "summary": "This 2013 Supreme Court of Ghana decision in Daniel Elias William Joseph v. Okomfo Ankye & Amoapong Stool addressed the timeliness of a civil appeal concerning an interlocutory injunction. The appeal was filed on 19 August 2011 against a Court of Appeal decision dated 29 July 2011, which had affirmed a High Court ruling refusing the injunction. The Supreme Court raised a jurisdictional issue sua sponte, questioning whether the appeal was filed within the mandatory 21-day period under Rule 8(1)(a) of CI 16. The Court held that an interlocutory injunction is not a final order and thus appeals from such rulings must comply strictly with the 21-day time limit. Since the appeal was filed beyond this period, the Court lacked jurisdiction to hear it on merits and struck it out accordingly, reaffirming that statutory timeframes for appeals are jurisdictional and non-extendable.",
