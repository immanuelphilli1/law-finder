  "caseTitle": "THE ATTORNEY GENERAL V . BALKAN ENERGY GHANA LTD, BALKAN ENERGY",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana was tasked with interpreting the phrase 'international business or economic transaction to which the Government is a party' under Article 181(5) of the 1992 Constitution, in the context of a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between the Government of Ghana and Balkan Energy (Ghana) Limited. The PPA, entered into on 27th July 2007, was challenged by the Attorney General for lack of required Parliamentary approval. The dispute arose after arbitration was initiated by the company under the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The Government argued the PPA and its arbitration clause were invalid due to non-compliance with Article 181(5). The Court referred two questions: whether the PPA and its arbitration clause constituted an international transaction requiring Parliamentary approval. The Court held that such a transaction must have a foreign element, assessed by the nationality or residence of parties or the seat of corporate control. It concluded that while the main contract could be international based on foreign control, the arbitration clause itself does not independently constitute such a transaction. The Court exercised its supervisory jurisdiction to ensure constitutional questions were properly referred.",
