  "caseTitle": "VADO VERSUS SEMPEDE",
  "summary": "In Vado v. Sempede, a land ownership dispute arose in Sovie Abayeme, Ghana, when a local authority sought to quarry on contested land. Two customary arbitrations were conducted: one by town elders favoring the plaintiff (Sub-Divisional Chief), and another by the Divisional Council favoring the defendant. The Native Court and Native Appeal Court upheld opposing awards without examining their validity. The High Court held that a binding customary arbitration requires prior mutual consent and that the party invoking an award must prove its validity. Since no evidence was presented to establish the legitimacy of either arbitration, both lower court decisions were set aside. The case was remitted for a trial de novo, allowing parties to prove the validity of the arbitrations or the underlying land claim.",
