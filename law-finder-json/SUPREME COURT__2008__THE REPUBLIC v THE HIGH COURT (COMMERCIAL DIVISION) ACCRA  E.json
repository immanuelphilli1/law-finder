  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana ruling addresses whether the High Court (Commercial Division) had jurisdiction to hear a fresh action challenging an aspect of a consent judgment concerning the interest rate on a loan. The Trust Bank Ltd. had obtained a consent judgment against Ampomah Photo Lab Ltd. and others, but later unilaterally included an interest rate of 35% per annum in the entry of judgment, which was not specified in the original agreement. The defendants filed a new action to set aside this interest provision, claiming mistake and misrepresentation. The Supreme Court held that a fresh action to challenge a consent judgment is a valid legal remedy, especially where appeal is not available. It emphasized that its supervisory jurisdiction under Article 132 of the Constitution applies only to fundamental or jurisdictional errors, not mere errors of law. Citing English and Ghanaian precedents, the Court affirmed that consent judgments, being based on agreement, can be set aside on grounds such as mistake, just like any contract. Therefore, the High Court was within its jurisdiction to entertain the fresh action, and the Supreme Court declined to issue certiorari.",
