  "caseTitle": "EX-PARTE MILLICOM GHANA LIMITED REGIS ROMERO TISMARK INJA P",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana reviewed an application for certiorari, prohibition, and directions against the High Court's issuance of a bench warrant for the arrest of directors of Millicom Ghana Limited for alleged contempt. The contempt arose from non-compliance with an injunction order issued by Marful-Sau JA and later interpreted by Kwofie J. The Supreme Court held that the committal process was unlawful because the individual directors were not served with the application, as required under Order 43 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 2004 (CI 47). It further ruled that the application for stay of execution was invalid because Kwofie J's ruling was interpretive, not a new executable order. The Court emphasized that committal of corporate officers requires personal service and that the High Court lacked jurisdiction to issue the bench warrant without such service. The first applicant company was ordered to be struck out of the committal proceedings, and further proceedings were prohibited unless proper service was effected on the directors.",
