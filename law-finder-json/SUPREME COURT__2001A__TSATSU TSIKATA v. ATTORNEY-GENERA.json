  "caseTitle": "TSATSU TSIKATA v. ATTORNEY-GENERA",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana, in a 5:4 decision on 28 February 2002, ruled in favor of Tsatsu Tsikata by declaring that the Fast Track Court, as used for criminal trials, lacked constitutional foundation under the 1992 Constitution. The Court issued declarations that the oral demand to appear before such a court, and the criminal summons issued by a Justice of Appeal, were unconstitutional and void, violating Articles 1(i), 125, and 126. An injunction was granted to restrain the Attorney-General from proceeding with the trial. The Attorney-General applied for a review on grounds of exceptional circumstances and alleged miscarriage of justice, citing inconsistency with a prior decision in Republic v. Selormey. The Court dismissed the review application, holding that no exceptional circumstances existed justifying a departure from its prior judgment, and emphasized that constitutional interpretation must prevail over administrative convenience.",
