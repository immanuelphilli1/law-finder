  "summary": "This case involved an appeal from a decision of the Divisional Court that had reversed a Magistrate's Court judgment and restored the original ruling of a Native Tribunal. The plaintiff sought to appeal further to the West African Court of Appeal under section 4 of the West African Court of Appeal Ordinance. The respondent raised a preliminary objection that the appeal did not lie because the Magistrate's Court in question was constituted by a District Commissioner acting outside the scope of a District Magistrate's functions, and thus did not qualify as a 'Magistrate's Court' under the statutory definition. The Court agreed, holding that the term 'Magistrate' as used in the relevant section of the West African Court of Appeal Ordinance must be interpreted according to the definition in the Courts Ordinance, which excludes a District Commissioner when performing non-magisterial functions. Consequently, the appeal was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, with costs awarded.",
