  "caseTitle": "ASAMOAH VERSUS KOUFU",
  "summary": "In Asamoah v. Koufu, the High Court of the Eastern Judicial Division, Land Court, addressed a land dispute where the Head of Awutu State claimed land on behalf of the state against a sub-chief of Fetteh State. The case was initially heard in the Awutu Native Court, which ruled in favor of the plaintiff. On appeal, the court raised sua sponte the issue of jurisdiction, holding that a Native Court of a state should not adjudicate disputes involving its own state's interests due to the risk of bias and conflict of interest, even if members act fairly. Citing principles from English and West African jurisprudence, the court emphasized that justice must not only be done but must also be seen to be done. Consequently, the judgment of the Native Court was set aside, and the case was remitted for transfer to the Land Court via the Magistrate's Court. Regarding costs, the court followed precedent by ordering each party to bear their own costs, as the jurisdictional issue was raised by the court, not the parties.",
