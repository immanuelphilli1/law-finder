  "summary": "This 1940 West Africa Court of Appeal decision from Accra, Ghana, involved a dispute over inheritance rights under Akyem Abuakwa customary law. The plaintiff, Gyasehene Sanahene Kwame Santeng, claimed succession to eighteen farms and two houses from Kwaku Adae, whose mother was a slave. The defendants, executors of Kwaku Adae's will, argued the property was self-acquired and passed under the will. The court upheld the custom that children of slave women are members of the father's family for succession purposes, affirming the plaintiff's standing. It dismissed the appeal regarding fourteen farms due to insufficient evidence of self-acquisition, but allowed the appeal concerning a storehouse built on the ruins of a family house, ruling it self-acquired since no family materials were used and mere site usage does not make it family property.",
