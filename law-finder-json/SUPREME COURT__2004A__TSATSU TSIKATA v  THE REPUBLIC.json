  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana judgment in Tsatsu Tsikata v. The Republic (CA. No: J3/4/2004, 27th October 2004) addressed whether a prima facie case was established against the appellant, a former Chief Executive of the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC), for wilfully causing financial loss to the state under Section 179A(3)(a) of the Criminal Code, 1960 (Act 29), as amended. The charges stemmed from payments made to Caisse Francaise de Development on behalf of Valley Farms Company Ltd., which had defaulted on a loan guaranteed by GNPC. The court, led by Atuguba J.S.C., held that the prosecution had established a prima facie case. The judge adopted a purposive interpretation of 'wilful' conduct, drawing from Lord Diplock's reasoning in R v Sheppard, requiring foresight of risk and unjustifiable or unreasonable risk-taking. The appellant's prior authorization of payments based on the guarantee (Exhibit 1) rendered the subsequent disbursements his acts, even if executed by a subordinate. The court emphasized that a prima facie case exists if, based on all the evidence, a reasonable mind could conclude guilt beyond reasonable doubt, per Section 11 of the Evidence Decree. Constitutional issues were avoided under the principle of constitutional avoidance. The judgment affirms strict accountability for public officials in financial decision-making and clarifies the mens rea required under Section 179A.",
