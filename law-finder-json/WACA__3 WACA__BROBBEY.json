  "summary": "This is an appeal from an administration suit in which the plaintiff-appellant sought Letters of Administration over the estate of his deceased uncles, Ado-Kwabu and Ardu Yaw, but was opposed by a caveat filed by the defendant, Yaw Kyere, who had already inherited the property under a death-bed declaration recognized by native customary law. The plaintiff had previously brought a claim before the Kumasihene Native Tribunal in 1934, seeking judicial relief, an account of property dealings, and an injunction against the defendant. The native tribunal found that the defendant inherited the property in accordance with a valid death-bed declaration confirmed by a 'great oath' and attested in accordance with native custom, and dismissed the plaintiff's claim. No appeal was taken. In 1935, the plaintiff initiated the administration suit, which the lower court dismissed based on the prior decision of the native tribunal, holding the matter res judicata and the plaintiff estopped by record. On appeal, the West Africa Court of Appeal upheld the ruling, affirming that the native tribunal was competent, the issues were identical, and the judgment constituted a final determination under native law. The appeal was dismissed.",
