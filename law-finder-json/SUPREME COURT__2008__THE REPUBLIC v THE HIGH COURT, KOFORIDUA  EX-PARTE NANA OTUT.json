  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC v THE HIGH COURT, KOFORIDUA EX-PARTE NANA OTUT",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana considered an application for certiorari to quash a High Court ruling that it had jurisdiction over a dispute involving the legitimacy of traditional councils in Akuapim. The applicant, Nana Otutu Konor III, argued that the High Court erred by hearing a matter affecting chieftaincy, which under the Courts Act, 1993 (Act 459) and the Chieftaincy Act, 2008 (Act 759), falls outside the jurisdiction of the High Court. The plaintiff sought declarations that only the Akwapem Traditional Council was lawful and that other councils were void, along with injunctions preventing the defendants from acting as Omanhene or operating through their councils. While the High Court held the matter was not chieftaincy-related, the Supreme Court, per Chief Justice Georgina Wood aligning with Justice Dotse, found that the core issues—particularly the status of the defendants as Paramount Chiefs—constituted a cause affecting chieftaincy. The Court emphasized that where evidence on enstoolment, allegiance, and customary procedures is required, the matter must be heard by a competent traditional authority. It held that the error was patent on the face of the record, justifying supervisory intervention via certiorari. The Court also stressed judicial economy and the risk of conflicting rulings if claims were split between forums. Consequently, the application was allowed, and the High Court's ruling was quashed.",
