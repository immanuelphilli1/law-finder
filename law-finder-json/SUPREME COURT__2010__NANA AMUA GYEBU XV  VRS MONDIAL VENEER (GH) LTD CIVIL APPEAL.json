  "caseTitle": "NANA AMUA GYEBU XV VRS MONDIAL VENEER (GH) LTD CIVIL APPEAL",
  "summary": "This is a civil land dispute before the Supreme Court of Ghana concerning the alleged encroachment by Mondial Veneer (Gh) Ltd on 29 acres of stool land beyond a 61-acre parcel originally leased in 1993. After the enstoolment of Nana Amua Gyebu XV in 2001, he discovered the defendant's expansion and initiated proceedings seeking declaration of title, recovery of possession, damages for trespass, and a perpetual injunction. The trial court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, a decision largely upheld by the Court of Appeal, which only reduced the awarded damages and costs. The Supreme Court dismissed the appellant's appeal, affirming that the appellant failed to meet the burden of proof under the Evidence Act (N.R.C.D 323) to establish a valid purchase of the additional land. Key deficiencies included reliance on a self-serving statutory declaration, failure to produce primary witnesses such as J.B. Eshun (who collected payment), and inconsistencies in the documentary evidence. The Court emphasized that concurrent findings of fact by two lower courts are not lightly disturbed and found no miscarriage of justice. The rectification of damages by the appellate court was deemed lawful and reasonable.",
