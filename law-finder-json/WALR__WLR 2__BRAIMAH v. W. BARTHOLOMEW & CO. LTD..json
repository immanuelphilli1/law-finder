  "caseTitle": "BRAIMAH VERSUS W. BARTHOLOMEW & CO. LTD.",
  "summary": "In Braimah v. W. Bartholomew & Co. Ltd., the plaintiff, a divorced husband, claimed half the value of improvements (buildings and fruit trees) made on land owned solely by his former wife prior to marriage. The improvements were funded from joint earnings during the marriage. The court held that the legal maxim 'quicquid plantatur solo, solo cedit' applied, meaning improvements become part of the land and belong to the landowner. The exception for equitable relief does not apply where the builder is aware of the title defect, as the plaintiff was. The marital relationship did not alter this principle, and no precedent supported recovery in such circumstances. The plaintiff's claim failed, and the defendant’s counterclaim for cattle was also dismissed due to lack of evidence.",
