  "caseTitle": "KWAMIN AKYIN",
  "summary": "This 1936 West Africa Court of Appeal case arose from a land dispute between Kwamin Akyin (plaintiff) and Essie Egymah (defendant) over alleged trespass on land known as Kwabor Kudu. The native tribunal initially ruled in favor of the plaintiff, but the Commissioner on appeal reversed the decision, citing that it was against the weight of evidence. The West Africa Court of Appeal allowed the plaintiff's appeal, restoring the native tribunal's judgment. The court held that the native tribunal had properly focused on the issue of ownership rather than trespass, consistent with native law and custom. It emphasized that appellate courts should not disturb factual findings of native tribunals without very clear proof of error, particularly on matters within their specialized knowledge. The Commissioner was found to have erred by re-evaluating witness credibility—particularly that of Rockson—and by overlooking evidence of the plaintiff's constructive possession, including the defendant's violation of an oath and the cutting of the plaintiff's palm trees. The court reaffirmed the principle that the form of action in native tribunals should not be overly scrutinized if the core issue is clear.",
