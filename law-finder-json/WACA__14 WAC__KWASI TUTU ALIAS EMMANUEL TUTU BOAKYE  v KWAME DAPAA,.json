  "summary": "In this 1952 West African Court of Appeal case from the Gold Coast (Ghana), the appellant, Kwasi Tutu alias Emmanuel Tutu Boakye, challenged a lower court judgment entered in favor of the respondent, Kwame Dapaa, in a dispute over the alleged fraudulent sale of land. The lower court had ordered pleadings without recording reasons, contrary to Order 25, rules 1 and 2, and entered judgment when the defendant failed to file a defence. The appellate court held that the order for pleadings was a nullity due to non-compliance with mandatory procedural rules, particularly the failure to record reasons. Although the defendant did not inform the court of his inability to understand English, the court emphasized adherence to legal rights. The real issue was the authenticity of the deed, not land ownership, so jurisdiction was proper. The appeal was allowed, and the case was remitted for retrial.",
