  "caseTitle": "GEORGE HAGAN AND OTHERS",
  "summary": "This consolidated appeal before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council arose from two judgments of the West African Court of Appeal concerning the estate of Thomas Hagan, a native of the Gold Coast Colony who died in 1931. The appellants, Hagan's siblings, had obtained letters of administration for his personal estate. The respondents included Effuah Adum and her children, claiming rights as the 'slave-wife' and offspring, and Araba Tanuah, asserting status as head of the deceased’s family. Suit A, initiated in the Native Tribunal of Winneba, sought declaration of the estate's value and allocation of shares. The Tribunal awarded one-fourth of both personal and real property to Adum and her children, with the remainder under Araba’s control. The Divisional Court and West African Court of Appeal upheld the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Suit B, filed in the Divisional Court by Araba, sought accounting and administration; initially dismissed, it was later allowed on appeal based on the res judicata effect of the Native Tribunal’s decision in Suit A. The Privy Council affirmed both lower courts, holding that the Native Tribunal had jurisdiction under section 43(2)(f) of the Native Administration Ordinance over succession matters, including valuation and distribution, independently of other jurisdictional limits. It rejected arguments based on prior arbitration, election of forum, and monetary or territorial restrictions, confirming the validity of concurrent proceedings in different courts.",
