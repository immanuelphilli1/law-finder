  "caseTitle": "LEGAL EFFECT OF OUSTER CLAUSES [1981– 82] VOLS. XII & XIV RG",
  "summary": "This legal analysis examines the effect of ouster clauses in both contractual and statutory contexts, focusing on their enforceability under public policy principles. It establishes that clauses attempting to completely oust the jurisdiction of courts—especially on questions of law—are void as contrary to public policy, while those deferring judicial intervention (e.g., until after arbitration or negotiation) are generally valid. Key English cases like Addison v. Brown, Baker v. Jones, and Re Davstone Estates illustrate that parties cannot contract out of court jurisdiction on legal interpretation, though factual determinations by private tribunals may be final. The Ghanaian case In re Timber and Transport Kumasi-Krusevac Co., Ltd. confirms that parties may validly agree to postpone legal actions such as winding-up for a fixed term, provided there is no fundamental breach. The overarching principle, affirmed by Lord Denning, is that public policy protects the courts' role in adjudicating legal rights, even within private contractual arrangements.",
