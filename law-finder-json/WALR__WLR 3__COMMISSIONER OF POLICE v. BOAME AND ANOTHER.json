  "summary": "In Commissioner of Police v. Boame and Another, the High Court of the Ashanti Judicial Division reviewed an order by the Senior Magistrate of Kumasi forfeiting the bail recognisances of two sureties, Kwasi Boame and another, following the accused's failure to surrender. The sureties were ordered to pay �1,000 each or face six months’ imprisonment, and were immediately committed to prison without prior attachment and sale of property. The High Court, per Murphy J, held that under section 104(2) and (4) of the Criminal Procedure Code, imprisonment in default of payment is only lawful after a warrant for attachment and sale has been issued and the penalty cannot be recovered through that means. The court found the Senior Magistrate’s order procedurally flawed and allowed the appeal. The order was set aside, and the sureties were directed to produce the accused or show cause why their recognisances should be forfeited by December 19, 1958. The court also recommended that, if forfeiture were reimposed, the Magistrate consider remitting the penalty under section 104(5) due to the appellants’ prior incarceration.",
