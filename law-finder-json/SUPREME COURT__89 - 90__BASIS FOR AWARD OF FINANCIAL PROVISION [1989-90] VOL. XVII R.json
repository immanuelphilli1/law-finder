  "caseTitle": "Ribeiro v Ribeiro2 in reserved",
  "summary": "In Ribeiro v Ribeiro, the Ghanaian Supreme Court, by a 3-2 majority, upheld the lower courts' decision to rescind the husband's transfer of 'Haulage House' to his new wife and order its conveyance to the former wife as part of financial provision under section 20(1) and 26(1) of the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1971 (Act 367). The husband had transferred multiple properties during proceedings, which the courts found to be in bad faith to defeat the wife's claim. The majority affirmed that a spouse's domestic contributions justify financial provision, including property transfer, even without direct financial contribution. The trial court also awarded 150,000 lump sum. The dissenting justices argued that courts lack statutory authority to transfer titled property absent proprietary interest and that financial provision should be limited to monetary awards. The case exposed deep judicial division on the scope of judicial discretion in marital property distribution.",
