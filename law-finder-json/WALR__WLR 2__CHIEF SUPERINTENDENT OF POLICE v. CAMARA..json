  "caseTitle": "CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE VERSUS CAMARA.",
  "summary": "The appellant, convicted of cattle theft in the Magistrate's Court of the Western Division of the Gambia, was sentenced to six months' imprisonment with hard labour and recommended for deportation as an alien under the Deportation (Aliens) Ordinance. On appeal, the High Court upheld the conviction due to sufficient evidence, including eyewitness identification and the appellant's prior convictions. However, the court set aside the recommendation for deportation because the prosecution failed to allege or prove the appellant's status as an alien, which is a legal requirement under the Ordinance unless admitted by the accused. The Chief Justice reiterated that alien status must be formally addressed during trial if deportation is sought.",
