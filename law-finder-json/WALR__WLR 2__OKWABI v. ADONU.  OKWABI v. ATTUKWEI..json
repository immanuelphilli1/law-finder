  "caseTitle": "OKWABI VERSUS ADONU.",
  "summary": "In this consolidated case from the West African Court of Appeal, the plaintiff, Okwabi, the duly appointed successor under native custom of the late Numo Kortey Kofi, sought damages for trespass, injunction, ejectment, and a declaration of title against defendants Adonu and Attukwei. The central issue was whether land purchased with money earned from the joint labor of Kortey Kofi and his son, Nii Attukwei, should be considered jointly owned or solely the property of the testator. The testator had devised the land via will to his maternal family, excluding Attukwei. The defendant Attukwei claimed joint ownership or that the land had been attached to a stool he occupied, but the trial court and appellate court rejected these claims due to lack of strong evidence. The appellate court upheld the trial court’s decision, affirming the will’s validity and the plaintiff’s title, dismissing the appeal with costs.",
