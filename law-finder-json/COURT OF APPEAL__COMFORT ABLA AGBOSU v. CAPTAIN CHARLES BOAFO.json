  "summary": "In Comfort Abla Agbosu v. Captain Charles Boafo, a 1999 Court of Appeal decision in Ghana, the plaintiff, Comfort Abla Agbosu, sued on her own behalf and on behalf of her children for a declaration of title, recovery of possession, damages for trespass, and a perpetual injunction over land in Gbejirmanya-Somanya. The land had been sold by her late husband, Seth Kwabla Agbosu, to the defendant, Captain Charles Boafo, who claimed to have acquired legal title after a registry search showed the deceased as sole owner. The High Court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, declaring the sale null and void. On appeal, the defendant challenged the standard of proof, the credibility of evidence from interested parties, and the trial court’s findings on joint ownership. The Court of Appeal upheld the High Court’s judgment, affirming that the standard of proof in civil land cases is the balance of probabilities, not beyond reasonable doubt. It found that the plaintiff and her children had contributed financially and in kind to the land acquisition and development, and that the deceased’s act of accepting schnapps from the plaintiff symbolized consent to their use and possession. The court rejected the defendant’s claim of indefeasible title, holding he had constructive knowledge of the plaintiff’s interest, and confirmed the plaintiff’s joint beneficial ownership despite the legal title being in the deceased’s name alone.",
