  "caseTitle": "REX v OSUMU FAGBAYI",
  "summary": "The appellant, Osumu Fagbayi, was brought before the High Court in Ibadan for a summary trial on short notice, despite prior notice that the preliminary investigation before the Magistrate had been adjourned to a later date. This resulted in the unavailability of both defense and prosecution witnesses, undermining the fairness of the trial. The appellate court, citing Lord Watson in *In re Dillet* (12 App. Cases 459), held that there had been a disregard of legal process leading to substantial and grave injustice. Consequently, the appeal was allowed, the conviction and sentence were quashed, and a verdict of acquittal was entered, with the appellant discharged.",
