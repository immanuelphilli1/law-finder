  "caseTitle": "FRANK DAVIES VRS THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL ,THE ELECTORAL COMMISSION",
  "summary": "In Frank Davies v. The Attorney-General & The Electoral Commission, the Supreme Court of Ghana unanimously held that the Minister for Local Government lacked constitutional authority to create electoral areas under the Local Government Act 1993 (Act 462). The plaintiff challenged various Legislative Instruments (LIs) that purported to divide local government areas into electoral areas, arguing this violated Article 45(b) of the 1992 Constitution, which grants the Electoral Commission the exclusive power to demarcate electoral boundaries. The Court agreed, declaring that any language in the LIs suggesting the Minister created electoral areas was ultra vires, unconstitutional, and void to the extent of inconsistency with Article 45(b). While the Court granted declarations of nullity regarding the offending provisions, it qualified the injunction against holding elections, allowing elections to proceed if based on electoral areas lawfully designated by the Electoral Commission. The judgment reinforced constitutional supremacy and the exclusive demarcation role of the Electoral Commission.",
