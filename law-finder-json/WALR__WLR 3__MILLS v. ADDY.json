  "caseTitle": "MILLS VERSUS ADDY",
  "summary": "In Mills v. Addy (1958), the High Court of Ghana addressed a dispute over land ownership within an Accra Ga matrilineal family. The plaintiff, a senior female descendant of the common ancestress Adaku Mansah, sued to declare the disputed properties as family property. The defendant, a grandson of Adaku Mansah through a different daughter, claimed ownership based on descent from his father, the last head of the family. The court held that in the absence of a formally appointed head, the eldest female of the most senior generation (the plaintiff) was entitled to represent the family. It further ruled that self-acquired property of a woman becomes family property under Ga custom, and upon the failure of the direct line of descent, reverts to the wider family. The court emphasized that family property is held in joint life interest by members and cannot be alienated by life tenants. Children from a six-cloth marriage do not inherit family property, only self-acquired property of their father. The decision affirmed that 'once family property, always family property,' preserving its character regardless of the number of surviving beneficiaries.",
