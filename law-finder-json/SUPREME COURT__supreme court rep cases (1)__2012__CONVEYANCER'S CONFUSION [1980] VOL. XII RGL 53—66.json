  "caseTitle": "CONVEYANCER'S CONFUSION [1980] VOL. XII RGL 53—66",
  "summary": "This legal commentary critiques the confusion in Ghana's conveyancing and stamp duty system arising from the interplay of the Stamp Act, 1965 (Act 311), the Land Registry Act, 1962 (Act 122), and the Conveyancing Decree, 1973 (N.R.C.D. 175). The author highlights the lack of clear policy behind stamp duty rates, exacerbated by currency reforms that led to complex and surreptitiously increased duties. The responsibility for stamp duty assessment lies with the Commissioner of Income Tax, creating challenges for conveyancers due to non-legal personnel making assessments without regard to legal principles. Courts often ignore insufficiency of stamps, focusing only on omission, and appeals are procedurally burdensome. The Land Registry system in Ghana records deeds but does not guarantee title, unlike true title registration systems. Post-1962, registration affects instrument validity under Act 122, but uncertainty persists due to conflicting applications and inadequate statutory warranties. The author calls for strict statutory interpretation to bring clarity and predictability to the system.",
