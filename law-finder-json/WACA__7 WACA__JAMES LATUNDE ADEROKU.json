  "caseTitle": "JAMES LATUNDE ADEROKU",
  "summary": "This West Africa Court of Appeal decision involved a mortgagee in possession dispute where the appellant, James Latunde Aderoku, challenged the quantum of compensation awarded for the respondents' (United Africa Company Limited) occupation of his mortgaged property at Plot 13D, Zaria. The trial court had awarded �272 10s 0d and ordered reconveyance. On appeal, the court held that mortgagees must account for all rents received during their possession, except where quiet possession was not granted. The appeal was allowed in part: the court affirmed the trial judge's determination of a fair average monthly rent at �7 and upheld the disallowance of rent for January to March 15th, 1933, due to lack of quiet possession. However, it ruled that the appellant was entitled to rent for the 31-month period from March 15th, 1935, to October 14th, 1937, increasing the award by �211. The judgment was accordingly varied to �489 10s 0d, with costs awarded to the appellant.",
