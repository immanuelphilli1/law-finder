  "caseTitle": "THE SCOPE AND EFFECT OF JUDICIAL POWER IN THE ENFORCEMENT AN",
  "summary": "This legal analysis examines the scope and effect of judicial power in enforcing and defending the 1992 Ghanaian Constitution, emphasizing its vesting in the judiciary under Article 125(3) and the Supreme Court's exclusive original jurisdiction over constitutional matters under Article 130. The paper traces judicial power through Ghana’s constitutional history from 1957 onward, highlighting continuity with prior constitutions while noting key developments such as the people as the source of justice (Article 125(1)) and enhanced enforcement mechanisms. It underscores judicial independence, the role of constitutional interpretation, and the influence of social, economic, and political policies in adjudication. The work also references landmark cases like Lardan v Attorney-General (No 2) to illustrate limitations on judicial review under earlier constitutional frameworks.",

However, the document appears truncated, particularly in the discussion of Ware v Ofori-Atta, which may affect completeness. Core constitutional provisions and jurisprudence are accurately represented.",
