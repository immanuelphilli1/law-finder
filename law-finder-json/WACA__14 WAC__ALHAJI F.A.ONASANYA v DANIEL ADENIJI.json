  "summary": "In this civil appeal before the West African Court of Appeal, the appellant (landlord) challenged the award of £400 in general damages to the respondent (tenant) after the landlord removed doors and windows from the leased premises while the tenant was still in occupation, following a notice to quit. The trial judge awarded substantial general damages, citing the defendant's high-handed conduct and failure to personally appear in defense. The appellate court held that the trial judge wrongly considered irrelevant factors, particularly the defendant’s conduct in not appearing personally, which should not influence the assessment of damages in a trespass claim. Applying the principle from Smith v. Schilling, the court found the damages so excessive that they could not reasonably have been awarded if only relevant considerations were taken into account. Accordingly, the appeal was allowed, damages were reduced from £400 to £200, and no order as to costs was made. The respondent was ordered to refund £200 to the appellant.",
