  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana case (Civil Appeal No. J4/24/2012, decided 23 January 2013) involved Plaintiffs Osei Ansong and Passion International School appealing the Court of Appeal's decision to allow Ghana Airports Company Ltd's application to set aside a writ on grounds of abuse of process. The dispute originated from a prior suit where the High Court granted summary judgment in favor of Ghana Airports Ltd after the Plaintiffs admitted the land belonged to the defendant. The Plaintiffs later filed a new action alleging fraud, claiming false representations by the defendant and state institutions compelled their admissions. The High Court allowed the case to proceed, but the Court of Appeal reversed, finding abuse of process. The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal, ruling that the allegations of fraud were conclusory and not sufficiently pleaded with factual particularity to justify setting aside the prior judgment, emphasizing that fraud must be clearly alleged and strictly proven.",
