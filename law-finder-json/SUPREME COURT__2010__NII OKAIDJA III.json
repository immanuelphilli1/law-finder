  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision in Nii Okaidja III v. Nii Tettey Ahinakwa II (Civil Appeal No. J4/20/2009, delivered 29th April 2010) addressed the procedural correctness of a civil action challenging the execution of a writ of possession in a chieftaincy dispute. The plaintiffs/respondents had initiated proceedings via a writ of summons seeking to set aside the writ of possession and obtain an injunction, arguing they were not notified as required under Order 43 rule 3(3) of CI 47. The Supreme Court held that the proper remedy for such an irregularity was an application by motion under Order 81 of CI 47, not a new action by writ. The Court found the use of a writ of summons to challenge procedural irregularities in execution to be fundamentally defective, rendering the entire action incompetent. Despite the trial High Court and Court of Appeal having ruled in favor of the respondents, the Supreme Court determined that the improper commencement of the action deprived the lower courts of jurisdiction. It emphasized that such defects could not be cured post-trial, especially where no early application was made to treat the writ as a motion. Consequently, the appeal was allowed, and the judgments of the lower courts were set aside due to the fatal procedural flaw.",
