  "caseTitle": "BAIL IN MURDER CASES [1989-90] VOL. XVII RGL 317—337",
  "summary": "This case examines the legal framework governing bail in murder cases in Ghana, focusing on the tension between Section 96(7)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1960 (Act 30), which appears to prohibit bail in murder cases, and constitutional protections under Article 21(3)(b) and (4) of the 1979 Constitution, which guarantee the right to liberty and release if there is unreasonable delay in prosecution. The High Court in Republic v Crentsil addressed whether bail could be rescinded in a murder case even when conditions were not violated, holding that courts possess inherent power to rescind bail when new evidence emerges that undermines the original decision. The court emphasized that a 'proper charge of murder' must be supported by sufficient evidence establishing all elements of the offense, particularly when invoking Section 96(7)(a). The ruling clarified that bail decisions must be based on objective evidential standards akin to those at committal or at the close of the prosecution's case. The district court had initially remanded the accused without recording facts or receiving a summary of evidence, which the High Court found insufficient to justify denial of bail. Ultimately, bail was upheld due to lack of a properly substantiated murder charge, highlighting the necessity of procedural fairness and constitutional compliance in pre-trial detention decisions.",
