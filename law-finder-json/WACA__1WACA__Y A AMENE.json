  "summary": "The West African Court of Appeal, in a 1931 decision involving Y. A. Amene (Plaintiff-Respondent) and Amanor (Defendant-Appellant), addressed the jurisdictional relationship between the Supreme Court and Native Tribunals under the Native Administration Ordinance concerning applications for Letters of Administration. The court held that the Supreme Court retains jurisdiction to grant Letters of Administration and is not ousted by sections 43 and 44 of the Native Administration Ordinance. It ruled that an applicant need not first litigate succession rights in a Native Tribunal, and that even when succession disputes arise during administration applications, the Supreme Court may proceed, though it may refer the issue of succession to a Native Tribunal under section 59 for determination and report. The final opinion affirmed the Supreme Court's authority to decide who should receive Letters of Administration based on the Tribunal's findings.",
