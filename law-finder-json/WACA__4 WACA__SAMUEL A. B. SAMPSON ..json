  "caseTitle": "SAMUEL A. B. SAMPSON .",
  "summary": "This appeal arose from a judgment by the Divisional Court of the Central Province, which declared a writ of possession issued by the Provincial Commissioner's Court null and void for lack of jurisdiction. The writ had been issued in favor of Abraham Essell based on a Privy Council judgment. Samuel A. B. Sampson, as administrator of Rebecca Davis's estate, sought to set aside the writ on grounds of fraud and lack of jurisdiction. The West African Court of Appeal held that the Divisional Court lacked jurisdiction because the plaintiff had an alternative and more appropriate remedy: moving the issuing court (Provincial Commissioner's Court) to recall the writ, a motion which was already pending. The Court emphasized that where a remedy exists within the original court and an appeal lies to the West African Court of Appeal under Section 86 of the Native Administration (Colony) Ordinance, a collateral action in another court is impermissible. The appeal was allowed, the lower court's judgment was set aside, and the plaintiff's claim was dismissed.",
