  "caseTitle": "AUGUSTINE ACKERSON & OTHERS v. TAKORADI FLOUR MILLS",
  "summary": "In Augustine Ackerson & Others v. Takoradi Flour Mills Limited, the Court of Appeal of Ghana considered a cross-appeal by employees dismissed in February 1990 after collecting unauthorized I.O.U.s, while others who committed similar acts were retained. The High Court had declared the dismissals unlawful and awarded damages. The defendant’s main appeal was struck out for non-compliance with procedural rules. The plaintiffs cross-appealed, arguing that the damages awarded were too low and incorrectly computed, citing difficulty in securing new employment and missed salary increments. The Court of Appeal upheld the principle that employees have a duty to mitigate losses but emphasized that this does not guarantee immediate re-employment. It clarified that Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board v. Agbettoh does not mandate a fixed 24-month damages period, and awards must reflect the realities of each case. The court rejected both the argument for automatic two-year compensation and the suggestion of only one month’s pay in lieu of notice, affirming the trial judge’s discretion in assessing reasonable mitigation time at five months. The judgment reinforced that courts must avoid awarding damages that compensate for work not performed.",
