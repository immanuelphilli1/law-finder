  "caseTitle": "SASUAKU III, MANCHE",
  "summary": "This civil appeal before the West African Court of Appeal in Accra on 24th November 1934 involved Sasuaku III, Manche of Manya Akromuase, claiming an account of market tolls collected by Sir E. Mate Kole, Konor of Manya Krobo, from Bissa Market between 1928 and 1932. The appellant alleged an oral agreement, later reduced to writing, under which tolls were to be divided equally among the parties and the Bissa Sanitary Board. The court found that even if the written document (Exhibit 'H') were genuine, it did not impose any duty on the respondent to collect tolls or account for them, nor was it executed by him. Therefore, no legal liability arose. The appeal was dismissed with costs of £59 4s, and the lower court's judgment was upheld.",
