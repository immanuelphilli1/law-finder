  "caseTitle": "C. A. V ANDERPUYE ...",
  "summary": "This 1935 West African Court of Appeal decision addressed preliminary objections to an appeal brought by G. B. Ollivant, Ltd against C. A. Vanderpuye. The plaintiff had obtained a judgment of £88 10s in the Police Magistrate's Court, which was reversed by the Divisional Court. The appellant then sought and obtained conditional, later final, leave to appeal to the West African Court of Appeal. The respondent raised two technical objections: that the appeal was not permissible because the original judgment was below £100, and that special leave was improperly granted when ordinary leave should have sufficed. The Court rejected both objections, holding that under Section 4(2) of the West African Court of Appeal Ordinance, an appeal lies as of right when a Divisional Court reverses or materially alters a Magistrate’s decision, irrespective of the claim amount, and that the procedural mechanism of special leave did not bar the appeal. The Court emphasized that technicalities should not obstruct substantial justice and allowed the appeal to proceed on its merits.",
