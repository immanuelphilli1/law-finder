  "caseTitle": "ALHAJI FASASI ADESHOYE v J. O. SHIWONIKU",
  "summary": "In Alhaji Fasasi Adeshoye v J. O. Shiwoniku, the plaintiff sued for trespass after purchasing a plot from an agent authorized by only three of six heirs of the original landowner, Salu Kayaoja, who died intestate. The defendant claimed ownership via a 1950 conveyance from two heirs relying on a deed of partition executed by only four heirs. The West African Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge's finding that, despite both parties having defective titles due to lack of full heir consent and absence of formal partition, the plaintiff's prior possession entitled him to maintain the trespass action. The court held that the defendant's conveyance was invalid as the grantors lacked authority to convey full title. Possession, not defective paper title, conferred standing to sue in trespass. The appeal was dismissed with costs.",
