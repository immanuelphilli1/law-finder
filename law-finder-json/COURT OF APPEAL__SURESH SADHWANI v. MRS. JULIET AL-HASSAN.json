  "summary": "In Suresh Sadhwani v. Mrs. Juliet Al-Hassan (CA No. 13/99, 20/10/1999), the Court of Appeal of Ghana dismissed a preliminary objection by the respondent challenging the appellant's late filing of submissions, finding that the respondent failed to comply with procedural rules requiring prior notice. The court proceeded to consider the merits of the appeal, which concerned the trial judge's refusal to grant summary judgment in a debt recovery case. The appellant argued that the respondent's uncontroverted undertaking to pay established liability, but the Court upheld the trial judge's finding that triable issues existed, including whether the undertakings were voluntary or made under the appellant's dictation, and whether partial payment had been made. The court emphasized that summary judgment should not be granted where there is a bona fide defence raising factual disputes requiring viva voce evidence and cross-examination. The decision reaffirmed that trial judges must not assess the merits of defences at the summary judgment stage, preserving the defendant's right to a full trial.",

  "confidenceNotes": "The summary is based on a truncated but substantial portion of the judgment, with clear articulation of procedural and substantive issues. Key holdings on summary judgment and procedural compliance are well-supported by cited authorities and judicial reasoning. Minor uncertainty exists due to document truncation near the end, but core reasoning and outcome are intact.",
