  "summary": "In this 1938 West Africa Court of Appeal case from Ghana, Peter Kwakyi (plaintiff-respondent) sued Kojo Bandoh (defendant-appellant) for malicious prosecution following criminal charges over a land dispute. Kwakyi had taken crops from land awarded to him by the Asantehene's Court but was prosecuted for stealing and unlawful damage. He was convicted in the Native Court, with sentences later reduced by the District Commissioner. On appeal to the Magistrate's Court, only the theft conviction was quashed on the grounds of 'claim of right,' while the damage conviction remained intact. Kwakyi then won damages for malicious prosecution in the Supreme Court, but the decision was reversed on appeal. The appellate court held that Kwakyi failed to prove the proceedings ended in his favour, failed to disprove reasonable and probable cause, and failed to prove malice. The appeal was allowed, the lower court's judgment set aside, and the claim dismissed with costs.",
