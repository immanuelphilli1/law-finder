  "caseTitle": "KWABENA ABOAGYE VRS THE CONTROLLER & ACCOUNTANT GENERAL THE ATTORNEY-GENERAL",
  "summary": "Kwabena Aboagye, a former public servant, appealed for the declaration that his service was continuous from 1966 to 2002 for pension purposes under Cap 30. He had worked in various government agencies until his termination in 1979 due to reorganization. In 2005, a letter from the Head of the Civil Service's representative condoned his break in service from 1971 to 1980, making his service continuous from 1966 to 1980 for pension purposes. The plaintiff claimed this condonation extended to 2002, but the trial court and Supreme Court held that the letter unambiguously limited the period to 1980. The court rejected his application for review, ruling that any error in the administrative letter must be corrected by the executive, not the judiciary. The Supreme Court upheld the lower courts' decisions, affirming entitlement only to pension benefits from 1966 to 1980.",
