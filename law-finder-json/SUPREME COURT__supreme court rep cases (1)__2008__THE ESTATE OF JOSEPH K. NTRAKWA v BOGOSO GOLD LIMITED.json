  "caseTitle": "THE ESTATE OF JOSEPH K. NTRAKWA v BOGOSO GOLD LIMITED",
  "summary": "This civil appeal before the Supreme Court of Ghana involves Bogoso Gold Limited challenging a Court of Appeal decision that upheld a High Court judgment awarding damages to the Estate of Joseph K. Ntrakwa. The core legal issue is whether a High Court judgment can be reviewed by a different High Court judge when the original presiding judge has been transferred, making review by the same judge impossible. The appellant argues that the review process was improperly conducted. The case engages fundamental principles of civil procedure, judicial continuity, and the finality of judgments. The Supreme Court is tasked with determining the proper interpretation of procedural rules regarding post-judgment review in such circumstances.",
