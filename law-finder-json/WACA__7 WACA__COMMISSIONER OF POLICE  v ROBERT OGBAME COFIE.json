  "summary": "In Commissioner of Police v Robert Ogbase Cofie (WACA, 12 December 1941), the appellant was convicted of stealing two shirts from the King's warehouse. Although the prosecution failed to prove that the specific shirts were missing from a warehouse bale, evidence showed a bale of similar shirts had been tampered with. The West Africa Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, ruling that stealing may be established through circumstantial evidence and that the corpus delicti need not be expressly proven. Citing multiple authorities, the court held that the evidence against the appellant was overwhelming, warranting dismissal of the appeal.",
