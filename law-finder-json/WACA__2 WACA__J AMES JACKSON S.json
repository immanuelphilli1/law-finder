  "caseTitle": "J AMES JACKSON S",
  "summary": "This 1936 Privy Council decision dismissed an appeal from the West African Court of Appeal concerning a land dispute in the Gold Coast Colony (now Ghana). The original action was initiated in a Native Tribunal over title to land, but it was found that proceedings under the Public Lands Ordinance were already pending in the Divisional Court involving the same land. The Privy Council upheld the lower court's ruling that, under Section 7 of the Public Lands Ordinance, the Native Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear the case while Divisional Court proceedings were ongoing. The judgment of the Native Tribunal and all subsequent proceedings were declared a nullity. The Privy Council affirmed the award of costs to the respondent, J. M. Cooke, in both the appellate and lower courts, finding no error in the construction of the Ordinance or in the exercise of judicial discretion regarding costs.",
