  "caseTitle": "KWASHIE GBO v KWABENA ANTIE & 1OR.",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana decision arose from a long-standing property dispute over House No. 270/9, Accra New Town, originally owned by the respondent, Kwashie Gbo. After the property was sold at public auction in 1987 to Odartey Lamptey, he allegedly sold it back to the respondent using funds contributed by the appellants. The core issue was whether the transaction between the parties constituted a pledge (with the respondent retaining ownership pending repayment) or an outright sale to the second appellant. The trial and appellate courts found in favor of the respondent, characterizing the arrangement as a pledge. The appellants appealed, challenging the admissibility of key documents (Exhibits R1 and R2) due to stamping irregularities and the failure to consider improvements they made to the property. The Supreme Court held that Exhibit R2, though stamped years after execution, was a conveyance under NRCD 175 and properly bore an impressed stamp, rejecting the lower courts' reasoning based on receipt classification under Act 311. However, the Court ultimately upheld the judgment for the respondent, finding insufficient evidence that the transaction was a sale. It also ruled that improvements made by the appellants did not confer ownership rights under the circumstances.",

    "The Court emphasized adherence to statutory definitions within the relevant Act rather than importing definitions from other sources.",
    "Improvements made by Appellants did not alter ownership where the underlying transaction was deemed a pledge."
