  "caseTitle": "ABU v. ESHUN (Osei-Hwere J., Cape",
  "summary": "This 1980 compilation from the Review of Ghana Law reports on personal injury awards from 1978–1979, primarily arising from road accidents. The cases cover both fatal injuries and multiple injury claims, with awards determined by various High Court judges across Ghana. In fatal cases, compensation includes loss of dependency (calculated by years' purchase of income), loss of expectation of life, mental distress to dependants, and special damages for funeral expenses. For non-fatal injuries, awards factor in pain and suffering, permanent disability, disfigurement, loss of amenities, loss of future earnings, and special damages. Judicial reasoning reflects structured assessment of pecuniary and non-pecuniary losses, with adjustments for likelihood of remarriage, age, earning capacity, and extent of physical and psychological impairment. The data serves as a benchmark for personal injury valuations in Ghanaian civil litigation during the period.",
