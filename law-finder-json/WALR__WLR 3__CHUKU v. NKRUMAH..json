  "caseTitle": "CHUKU VERSUS NKRUMAH.",
  "summary": "In Chuku v. Nkrumah, the plaintiff sued the defendant for slander after being called a 'rascal thief' during a dispute over a trade transaction. The Tarkwa/Abosso Native Court awarded the plaintiff �20 in damages, but the Magistrate's Court reversed the decision on appeal. The High Court, on further appeal, reinstated the Native Court's judgment. Sarkodee-Adoo J. held that calling someone a 'rascal thief' constitutes an imputation of a crime punishable by corporeal punishment and is therefore actionable per se, requiring no proof of special damage. The court distinguished between defamatory statements implying criminal guilt and mere vulgar abuse, ruling that the latter only applies if words are spoken in the heat of passion without consideration. The court found that the defendant failed to prove such circumstances, and the plaintiff had successfully proven the claim. Authorities including Webb v. Beavan and Amoah v. Djabi were cited to support the principle that general accusations of criminality are actionable. The appeal was allowed with costs.",
