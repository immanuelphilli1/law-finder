  "caseTitle": "BOOK REVIEW THE ART OF CROSS-EXAMINATION [1989-90] VOL. XVII",
  "summary": "This document is a book review of two publications by Nat Heward-Mills: 'The Art of Cross-Examination' (1988) and its companion, 'A Handbook of Cross-Examination' (1991). The review, published in the Review of Ghana Law 1989\u000090, highlights the practical and instructive nature of both works, which draw from the author's personal experience as a barrister. The books emphasize thorough preparation, strategic questioning, and mastery of the Evidence Decree, 1972 (NRCD 323). The author advocates for a theme-based approach to cross-examination and cautions against aggressive or disorganized techniques. The review notes the absence of a subject index in the first book, remedied in the second, and praises the clarity, lack of typographical errors, and real-case illustrations. Both books were launched at formal ceremonies in Ghana by senior judicial figures.",
