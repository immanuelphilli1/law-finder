  "caseTitle": "EXPRESS LTD. v. MOHAMMED ABDULAI & ANOR",
  "summary": "The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal filed by City Express Ltd. against the judgment of the trial court in favor of Mohammed Abdulai and another respondent. The appellate court found that the trial judge committed fundamental procedural errors by determining the case through legal arguments without compliance with Order 30 Rule 5 and Order 25 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules. The court held that the adjournment for 'further consideration' lacked basis, as no party had requested further directions. It further ruled that taking legal arguments without demonstrating their potential to dispose of the case and without the parties' consent was irregular. Additionally, the trial judge improperly considered factual matters not supported by evidence, including the respondents' ages and termination letters, and attempted to retrospectively regularize this by taking oral evidence during judgment. These actions rendered the judgment fundamentally flawed and a nullity. Consequently, the Court of Appeal set aside the ruling and ordered a retrial in accordance with the law.",
