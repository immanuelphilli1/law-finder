  "caseTitle": "KORANG VERSUS ATTA",
  "summary": "In Korang v. Atta and Others, the plaintiff appealed a Native Court decision awarding her damages for trespass to forest land near Banso, Ghana. The plaintiff claimed she had entered the land thirty years earlier to cultivate it, cutting wild climbers but not demarcating boundaries or planting crops due to ill-health. Shortly before the suit, she planted cocoa-yams upon finding others had cultivated the land. The High Court, per Ollennu J., allowed the appeal, holding that mere cutting of climbers without subsequent cultivation or boundary marking did not amount to legal possession under native custom. The court emphasized that unclaimed forest land is not possessed until it is cleared, demarcated, and cultivated. The plaintiff’s failure to act over thirty years and inability to identify the land conclusively defeated her claim. The Native Court’s judgment was deemed unreasonable, and the claim was dismissed with costs to the defendants.",
