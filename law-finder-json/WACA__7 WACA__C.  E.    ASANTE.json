  "caseTitle": "C. E. ASANTE",
  "summary": "The case involved land sold in execution of a decree by the Divisional Court of the Asantehene. Five days before the sale, the claimant applied for an interpleader summons asserting ownership, though the summons was issued after the sale. The lower courts relied on Supreme Court Rules regarding interpleader actions, but the West Africa Court of Appeal held these rules did not apply as there was no provision making them applicable in Ashanti Native Courts. While the reliance on Supreme Court Rules was incorrect, the Court upheld the declaration of ownership because the issue of ownership was clear, consistent with the principle in Abuagyi II v. Gyebu. However, the order setting aside the sale was invalidated because neither the vendor nor purchaser were parties to the proceedings. The appeal was dismissed with costs.",
