  "caseTitle": "Okorie v. The Republic1 and Taylor",
  "summary": "The case of Tinieye, alias Killer v. The Republic, heard in the High Court of Bolgatanga on 15 August 1979, addressed the admissibility of confession statements obtained without informing the accused of their right to counsel. Despite prior judicial decisions in Okorie v. The Republic and Republic v. Akosah holding such statements inadmissible under the 1969 Constitution, the Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Decree, 1975 (S.M.C.D. 3) explicitly rendered such statements admissible regardless of non-compliance with constitutional rights. Taylor J. rejected arguments that the court should refuse to enforce what was deemed oppressive legislation, affirming that courts must apply clear legislative enactments even if perceived as unjust, and that judicial resistance to such laws should take the form of resignation rather than judicial overreach. The judge emphasized that statutory interpretation must follow plain language unless ambiguity exists, warning against judicial usurpation of legislative power.",
