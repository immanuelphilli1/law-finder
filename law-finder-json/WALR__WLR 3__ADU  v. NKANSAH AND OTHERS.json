  "caseTitle": "ADU VERSUS NKANSAH AND OTHERS",
  "summary": "In this 1957 High Court decision from the Eastern Judicial Division of Ghana, the plaintiff, representing a land 'company', claimed damages for trespass and sought possession of land being cultivated by subjects of the Nteso Stool. The land was part of a larger tract sold by the Nteso Stool to the plaintiff's predecessors and confirmed during a 1926 Forest Reserve Inquiry, where the Stool supported the plaintiff's claim for compensation as alienation claimants. The trial Native Court had dismissed the claim and ordered partition of the land, which the High Court found to be beyond its jurisdiction. The appellant court held that the defendants were estopped by conduct from denying the plaintiffs' title due to their prior support of the claim, and that Native Courts lack authority to order partition or grant relief not specifically claimed. The appeal was allowed, the lower court's orders were set aside, and judgment was entered for the plaintiff for damages and recovery of possession.",
