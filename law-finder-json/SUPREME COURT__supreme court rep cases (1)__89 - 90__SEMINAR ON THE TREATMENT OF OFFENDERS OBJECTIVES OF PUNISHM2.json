  "caseTitle": "SEMINAR ON THE TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS OBJECTIVES OF PUNISHM2",
  "summary": "This legal commentary by A.N. Dokurugu, published in the Review of Ghana Law (1989\u000190), examines the objectives and social functions of punishment within the criminal justice system. The author analyzes punishment not as an end in itself but as a means to achieve various societal goals, including deterrence, prevention, retribution, expiation, restitution, and reformation. It emphasizes that in an imperfect society, punishment is necessary for the enforcement of laws and the self-defence of the state. Deterrence requires that penalties clearly outweigh criminal gains and be perceived as likely. Retribution reflects societal disapproval of crime, while expiation allows the offender to 'pay' for their wrongdoing. Restitution focuses on compensating victims, ideally by the offender, but potentially by the state. The paper highlights the role of social work in corrections, advocating for rehabilitation through structured treatment programmes, family engagement, and community reintegration. The author underscores the importance of multi-disciplinary coordination and the use of community resources to support behavioural change and reduce recidivism.",
