  "caseTitle": "DUVAT AND HAQUIN",
  "summary": "This civil appeal before the West African Court of Appeal arose from a judgment in the Supreme Court of the Gambia, where the defendant, Louis Orcel (operator of the Barthurst Ferry Company), was absolved of liability for the loss of a motor car owned by Huchard and later assigned to the plaintiffs, Duvat and Haquin. The car capsized while being ferried across the River Gambia. The plaintiffs appealed on grounds of alleged judicial error regarding negligence, common carrier status, and Act of God. The Court dismissed the appeal. It held that the motion for leave to appeal was timely, as the filing date—not the hearing date—constituted the application. Crucially, the assignment of the right of action occurred after the suit was filed and without notice to the defendant, rendering the plaintiffs' claim invalid under section 25(6) of the Judicature Act, 1873. Additionally, the plaintiffs failed to allege or prove that the defendant was a common carrier, so the higher standard of liability did not apply. Even assuming such status, the loss was due to an Act of God—severe weather conditions—and the defendant took reasonable steps to mitigate risk. No evidence of negligence in loading or navigation was established, and the plaintiffs failed to prove the value of the car. Thus, the appeal was dismissed with costs.",
