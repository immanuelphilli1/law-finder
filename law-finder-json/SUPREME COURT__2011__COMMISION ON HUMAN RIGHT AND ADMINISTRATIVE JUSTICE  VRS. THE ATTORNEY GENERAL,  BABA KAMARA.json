  "caseTitle": "COMMISION ON HUMAN RIGHT AND ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE VRS. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, BABA KAMARA",
  "summary": "The Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) initiated proceedings in the Supreme Court seeking a declaration that its mandate under Article 218(e) of the 1992 Constitution extends to investigating private individuals, such as Baba Kamara, who are alleged to be involved in acts of bribery or corruption with public officials. The second defendant raised a preliminary objection, arguing the case was moot due to a High Court order prohibiting CHRAJ from investigating him on grounds of bias—a decision then under appeal. The Supreme Court overruled the objection, holding that the matter was not moot given the ongoing legal dispute over CHRAJ’s constitutional mandate. It further ruled that the original jurisdiction of the court under Article 2(1)(b) was properly invoked to resolve questions of constitutional interpretation, even absent a direct constitutional violation by the defendant. The Court affirmed that CHRAJ’s investigative authority under Article 218(e) includes private persons implicated in corruption involving public officials.",
