  "caseTitle": "BOAKYE VERSUS BRONI AND DOMFE.",
  "summary": "In Boakye v. Broni and Domfe, the plaintiff appealed a Native Court decision dismissing his claim to a cocoa farm as successor to his late brother. The first defendant, the stepfather, claimed he originally cultivated the farm, gifted it to the deceased brother without formalities, and sought to revoke the gift due to lack of witnesses and the family's refusal to repay an alleged private loan. The High Court held that while the Native Court's factual finding that the defendant originated the farm was supported by evidence, it did not defeat the plaintiff's claim. The court emphasized that a gift of land under customary law is irrevocable once completed and the donee is in possession. It found that the defendant's long-standing conduct—allowing the deceased to occupy the farm for twenty years, acknowledging his control, and later billing the family for maintenance—constituted sufficient publicity to validate the transfer. Even if revocation were possible, the defendant's subsequent conditional re-grant of the farm in exchange for repayment of the debt, and acceptance of partial payment, amounted to a new, enforceable conveyance. The appeal was allowed, and the plaintiff's title was recognized.",
