  "caseTitle": "AMUQUANDOH VERSUS AGGREY.",
  "summary": "In Amuquandoh v. Aggrey, the plaintiff sought to recover rent for the defendant's prior use and occupation of land, following earlier litigation where the plaintiff successfully obtained a declaration of title and damages for trespass. The defendant had occupied the land adversely and without permission. The High Court held that an action for use and occupation is founded on contract—either express or implied—and cannot lie where the defendant's possession was adverse or as a trespasser. Citing Churchward v. Ford, Phillips v. Homfray, and Attorney-General v. De Keyser's Royal Hotel, the court ruled that no implied contract arises from wrongful occupation, and thus the plaintiff's claim failed. The statement of claim was struck out for disclosing no cause of action.",
