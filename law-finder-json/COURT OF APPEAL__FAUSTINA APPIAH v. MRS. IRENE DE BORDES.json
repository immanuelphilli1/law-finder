  "caseTitle": "FAUSTINA APPIAH v. MRS. IRENE DE BORDES",
  "summary": "In Faustina Appiah v. Mrs. Irene de Bordes, the Court of Appeal of Ghana overturned a High Court decision that invalidated a will due to disputed signature authenticity. The testator, Harold Smith Boatin, executed a will on February 8, 1988, three weeks before his death, with two attesting witnesses and a secretary present. The trial court rejected the will based on a handwriting expert's opinion that the signature differed from known samples, particularly due to a line beneath it. However, the Court of Appeal found that the trial judge erred in disregarding the credible, unchallenged testimony of the attesting witnesses and the will's proper execution. The appellate court emphasized that attestation evidence carries significant weight and that minor signature variations do not invalidate a will when eyewitness accounts confirm due execution. The appeal was allowed, and the will was declared valid.",
