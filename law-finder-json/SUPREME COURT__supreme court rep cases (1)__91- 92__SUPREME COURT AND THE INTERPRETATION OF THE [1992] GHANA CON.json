  "caseTitle": "SUPREME COURT AND THE INTERPRETATION OF THE [1992] GHANA CON",
  "summary": "This legal analysis examines the interpretive approaches adopted by Ghana's Supreme Court in constitutional and statutory matters, focusing on the tension between literalist and purposive/creative methods. It reviews key cases such as Asibey III v Ayisi (literalist approach) and Armah v Naawu (creative approach), highlighting judicial ambivalence. The article discusses the Supreme Court's original and appellate jurisdiction under the 1992 Constitution, including its power to invalidate legislation, review elections, and interpret fundamental rights. It further explores whether constitutional interpretation should follow the letter or spirit of the law, referencing comparative jurisprudence from the UK and Nigeria. The analysis underscores the court's role in balancing legislative intent with justice, especially in transitional constitutional provisions and human rights enforcement.",
