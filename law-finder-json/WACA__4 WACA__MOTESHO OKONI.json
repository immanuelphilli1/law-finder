  "caseTitle": "MOTESHO OKONI",
  "summary": "The appellants, including the Bale of Igboora and his two messengers, were convicted of murder for setting fire to a house in pursuit of an unlawful purpose—expelling Shitta Agboola from the town. The fire, ordered by the Bale and executed by his messengers, resulted in the death of Yesajo, who was severely burned and later died in hospital. The prosecution established that the accused acted under an unlawful directive, using arson—a dangerous act likely to endanger human life—in furtherance of their objective. The defense alibi was rejected at trial and abandoned on appeal. The appellate court upheld the conviction, emphasizing that under Section 316(3) of the Nigerian Criminal Code, murder is established when death results from an act done in prosecution of an unlawful purpose that is likely to endanger human life, regardless of intent to kill. This differs from English law, which requires the underlying act to constitute a felony involving violence. The court found no misdirection by the trial judge and dismissed the appeal.",
