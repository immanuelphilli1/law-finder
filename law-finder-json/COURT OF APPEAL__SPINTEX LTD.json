  "summary": "This is a civil appeal before the Ghana Court of Appeal concerning a dispute between Spintex Ltd (appellant) and Evans Atta-Edua (respondent). The appellant claimed recovery of GHS110,175,349.74 for goods supplied between 1990 and 1992, but the High Court dismissed the claim and upheld the respondent's counterclaim for GHS6,772,000 wrongfully withheld. The core issue was whether payments made by the respondent to the appellant’s Chief Accountant—later found to have misappropriated funds—constituted valid payments to the company. The Court of Appeal affirmed the High Court’s decision, holding that under section 142 of the Companies Act, 1963 (Act 179), the respondent was entitled to assume the Chief Accountant had authority to receive payments, especially since supplies continued and there was no indication of lack of authority. The court applied the doctrine of ostensible authority and estoppel, citing *GODKA Group v. P S International* and the *Turquand* rule. The appellant’s additional grounds of appeal were struck out for being improperly framed as issues rather than challenges to trial court determinations. The appeal was dismissed, affirming the respondent's victory.",
