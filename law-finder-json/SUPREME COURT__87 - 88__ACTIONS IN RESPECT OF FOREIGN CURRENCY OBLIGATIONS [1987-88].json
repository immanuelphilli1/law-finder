  "summary": "In Hungarotex Foreign Trading Company for Textiles v. Emmanuel Ofori-Boateng, a Ghanaian businessman defaulted on a US$86,250 debt owed to a Hungarian corporation for goods supplied under a 1979 contract. After partial payments and failed installment agreements, court proceedings began in 1984. The High Court entered a consent judgment requiring payment in cedis at the prevailing bank rate, later allowing installment payments. When the debtor sought to amend the judgment to fix the exchange rate at the date of breach, the High Court agreed, but the Court of Appeal reversed this, permitting conversion at the date of actual payment. The majority, citing changes in English law and Order 74 of the Civil Procedure Rules, held that Ghanaian courts could apply contemporary English practice in absence of local rules. They emphasized fairness in compensating creditors in fluctuating currency regimes. The dissent argued the court was bound by precedent from Societe Generale, which prohibited foreign currency judgments. The case raised key issues on whether foreign currency obligations should be converted at the date of breach or payment, ultimately favoring a rational, equitable approach aligned with modern principles.",
