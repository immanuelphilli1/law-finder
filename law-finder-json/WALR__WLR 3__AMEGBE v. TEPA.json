  "caseTitle": "AMEGBE VERSUS TEPA.",
  "summary": "In Amegbe v. Tepa, the High Court of the Eastern Judicial Division in Ghana considered whether a defamation claim brought before a Native Court involved a 'cause or matter of a constitutional nature' under section 14A of the Native Courts (Southern Togoland) Ordinance, which would remove the Native Court's jurisdiction. The plaintiff, Odikro Amegbe, had previously been confirmed by a competent tribunal as a duly elected and installed chief who had not been deposed. The defendant, Tepa, allegedly published statements challenging Amegbe’s use of the title 'Odikro', warning he would sue to stop it. The High Court held that the prior determination of Amegbe’s chiefly status was a judgment in rem, binding on all parties including Tepa, who had participated in the earlier proceedings. Therefore, the defamation suit was a personal matter, not a constitutional dispute, and fell within the jurisdiction of the Native Court. The application for certiorari was dismissed with costs.",
