  "caseTitle": "HE REPUBLIC VRS HIGH COURT (COMM. DIV.), ACCRA",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana ruled that the High Court (Commercial Division) breached Article 130(2) of the 1992 Constitution by failing to refer constitutional questions regarding the interpretation of Article 181(5) to the Supreme Court. The case centered on whether a power purchase agreement (PPA) between the Government of Ghana and Balkan Energy Ghana Limited—an entity incorporated locally but wholly owned by a foreign company—constituted an 'international business transaction' requiring parliamentary approval. The Supreme Court emphasized that despite prior interpretation in Attorney General v. Faroe Atlantic Co. Ltd, the scope of Article 181(5) remained contested and required authoritative determination by the Supreme Court. The Court declared the High Court’s refusal to refer the matter unconstitutional and exercised its supervisory jurisdiction under Articles 129(4) and 132 to refer two specific constitutional questions back for determination.",
