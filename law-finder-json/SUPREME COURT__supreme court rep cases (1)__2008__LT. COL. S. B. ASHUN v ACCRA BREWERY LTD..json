  "caseTitle": "LT. COL. S. B. ASHUN v ACCRA BREWERY LTD.",
  "summary": "In LT. Col. S. B. Ashun v Accra Brewery Ltd., the Supreme Court of Ghana held that the plaintiff's acceptance of a severance package after being declared redundant extinguished his right to further legal claims, absent an express reservation of rights. The court rejected the argument that there was a legal duty to negotiate severance pay under the Labour (Amendment) Decree 1969, NLCD 342, clarifying that its provisions on negotiation apply only to organizational closures or amalgamations, not redundancy. It emphasized that a contract of employment is not a guarantee of lifelong employment and that damages for wrongful termination are limited to a reasonable period for securing new employment, subject to the duty to mitigate. The appeal was dismissed, affirming that the termination was not wrongful due to the mutual agreement implied by acceptance of the package.",
