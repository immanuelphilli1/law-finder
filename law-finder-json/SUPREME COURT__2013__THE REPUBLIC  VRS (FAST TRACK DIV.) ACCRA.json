  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC VRS (FAST TRACK DIV.) ACCRA",
  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana ruling addresses the constitutional issue of whether public funds can be attached in execution of judgment debts against the state. The court held that under Article 293 of the 1992 Constitution, the Republic is liable like a private person, and judgments against it can be enforced without requiring a fiat or petition of right. The applicant's argument that public funds cannot be attached was rejected, with the court emphasizing that such enforcement is essential to uphold the rule of law and ensure state accountability. The decision distinguishes outdated common law doctrines and aligns with modern Commonwealth jurisprudence, particularly citing the Crown Proceedings Act 1947 (UK) and Australian authority in New South Wales v Bardolph. The court affirmed that the validity and enforceability of state obligations, including execution against public funds, must be maintained to protect citizens' rights and the state's creditworthiness.",
