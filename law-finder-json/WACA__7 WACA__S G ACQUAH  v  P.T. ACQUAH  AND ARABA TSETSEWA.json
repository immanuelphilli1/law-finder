  "summary": "This 1941 West Africa Court of Appeal decision in Ghana (then Gold Coast) concerned a civil trespass action over a cocoa plantation at Asuantsi, Abura. The plaintiff, S.G. Acquah, sued for damages after defendants removed cocoa from a plantation he claimed under his father Joseph Dobson Acquah's will. The native tribunal found the plantation was Joseph's self-acquired property, validly devised by will, and that the defendants had trespassed. The Provincial Commissioner reversed, but the WACA restored the native tribunal's judgment. The appellate court held that the native tribunal's factual findings—particularly that Joseph was the personal owner, that family labor did not make it family property, and that the will referred to the disputed farm—were supported by evidence and should not be disturbed absent clear error. The court emphasized the exclusive original jurisdiction of native tribunals in land matters under native tenure and the presumption of individual ownership when established by personal effort.",
