  "summary": "The document is a list of unreported civil appeals heard by the Supreme Court of Ghana in 2010. One of the listed cases is Maakye Korkor Akunsah v Nai Ashalley Botchway (Chief of Awutu of Aadaa Family Stool, Awutu) and Jei River Farm Limited, cited as Civil Appeal No. J4/36/2009, decided on 19th May 2010. The full judgment is not provided, but the case likely involves a land or property dispute, possibly concerning stool land, customary ownership, or inheritance under Ghanaian traditional law, given the parties involved. The presence of a chief and a family stool suggests issues related to native law and custom, land administration, or rights over family or communal property.",
