  "summary": "The case of Enterprise Insurance Company Ltd v. Albert Adomako Scantravel Ghana Ltd centered on the enforcement of a renewal clause in a 25-year sub-lease agreement dated 18th June 1971, under which Consortium House Ltd (a subsidiary of Enterprise Insurance) was granted a peppercorn lease of land on High Street, Accra. The plaintiffs sought a declaration that they were entitled to renew the lease and specific performance of the renewal terms. A key issue was whether Enterprise Insurance, after acquiring all shares in Consortium House Ltd in 1994, could enforce the renewal right despite plans for the subsidiary's liquidation. The defendant argued the transaction was structured to avoid capital gains tax and included an intention to liquidate the company, thereby extinguishing the leasehold right. The Supreme Court examined correspondence, particularly Exhibit H, and concluded that the renewal right vested in the corporate entity, Consortium House Ltd, and could be enforced so long as it remained in existence and compliant with lease terms. The Court upheld the plaintiffs' entitlement to renewal, emphasizing that the decision to liquidate was not mandatory and had not yet occurred.",
