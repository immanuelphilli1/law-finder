  "caseTitle": "C. S. HELLEL v ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX.",
  "summary": "This 1952 West African Court of Appeal decision in Hellel v. Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax addressed convictions under section 65 of the Income Tax Ordinance for failure to pay assessed taxes and penalties for the years 1943-44 and 1948-49. The appellant argued that a payment of £402 was in full settlement of earlier tax liabilities and that acquittals on two withdrawn counts barred liability. The court held that acquittal on non-payment charges does not discharge tax debt unless based on proof of payment, per section 76. It further ruled that the Assistant Commissioner was competent to prosecute, as the Ordinance did not restrict who could initiate proceedings, allowing any person to do so under section 59 of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance. Both convictions were upheld.",
