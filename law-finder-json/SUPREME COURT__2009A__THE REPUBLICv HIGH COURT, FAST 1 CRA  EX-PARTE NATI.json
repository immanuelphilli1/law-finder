  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC VERSUS HIGH COURT, FAST TRACK 1, ACCRA ...",
  "summary": "This is a ruling by the Supreme Court of Ghana in a constitutional and administrative law matter concerning the legality of an interim injunction granted by the Fast Track High Court, Accra. The National Lottery Authority (NLA), as applicant, sought certiorari to quash an injunction that allowed private lotto operators—aggrieved by the NLA's enforcement of the National Lotto Act, 2006 (Act 722)—to continue operating pending appeal. The Supreme Court held that Act 722, which outlawed private lotto operations unless operators transitioned under its framework, had rendered such activities illegal after 30 March 2007. The Court found that the High Court judge committed an error of law by granting an injunction that effectively authorized ongoing illegality, thereby exceeding judicial jurisdiction. Emphasizing legislative supremacy and the duty of courts to uphold statutes, the Court quashed the injunction, ruling it ultra vires and contrary to public policy. The decision reaffirms that judicial discretion cannot be used to permit breaches of statutory law.",
