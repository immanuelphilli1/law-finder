  "caseTitle": "REX v ABRIEL JOES NW AGBANI",
  "summary": "In Rex v Abriel Joes Nwagbani, the West Africa Court of Appeal heard an appeal from a conviction for stealing by a clerk under section 390(6) of the Criminal Code. The appellant, a clerk at Messrs John Holt & Co., was found to be £16 6s 9½ short in his stamp-related accounts. He had drawn funds via vouchers and maintained an outgoings book, but the shortfall was deemed a general deficiency. The appellate court held that a general accounting deficit, without evidence of theft of specific items or funds, was insufficient to sustain a criminal conviction for stealing. The court emphasized that criminal liability requires proof of specific dishonest acts, not mere suspicion or civil-level discrepancies. Consequently, the conviction and sentence were quashed, and an acquittal was entered. The appellant was discharged.",
