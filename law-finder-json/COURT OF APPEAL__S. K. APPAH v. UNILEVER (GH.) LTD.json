  "caseTitle": "APPAH v. UNILEVER (GH.) LTD.",
  "summary": "In S. K. Appah v. Unilever (Ghana) Ltd., the Court of Appeal reviewed a High Court ruling that granted an extension of time to appeal after significant delays. The respondent’s claim was dismissed in 1996 for want of prosecution due to repeated absences, while the appellant succeeded on a counterclaim in 1997. The respondent’s new counsel filed an extension application in January 1998—over 21 months late—citing poor performance by prior counsel. The trial judge granted the extension based on the 'chequered nature' of the case without analyzing required legal conditions. The Court of Appeal found the trial judge failed to properly assess whether there were good and substantial reasons for delay or prima facie grounds of appeal, as mandated by C.I. 19, Rules 4 and 5. It emphasized that procedural defaults do not automatically void judgments and that parties must meet statutory conditions for extensions. The appeal was allowed, and the extension order set aside.",
