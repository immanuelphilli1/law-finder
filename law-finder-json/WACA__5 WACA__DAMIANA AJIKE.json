  "caseTitle": "DAMIANA AJIKE",
  "summary": "This 1939 West African Court of Appeal decision involved an appellant, Damiana Ajike, seeking to enforce a debt claim barred by the Statute of Limitations. The central issue was whether a letter from the respondent constituted a clear acknowledgment of debt or an unconditional promise to pay, which would restart the limitation period. The letter stated the respondent hoped a lawyer's arrival would 'put the matter right,' which the court found ambiguous and conditional, not amounting to an absolute acknowledgment. Relying on established English common law precedents, the court held that only an unqualified acknowledgment or unconditional promise to pay can remove a case from the statute's bar. The appeal was dismissed, affirming the lower court's dismissal of the claim, with costs awarded.",
