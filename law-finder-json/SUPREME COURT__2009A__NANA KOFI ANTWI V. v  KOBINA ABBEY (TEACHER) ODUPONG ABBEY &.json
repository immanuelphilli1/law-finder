  "caseTitle": "NANA KOFI ANTWI V. v KOBINA ABBEY (TEACHER) ODUPONG ABBEY &",
  "summary": "In this civil appeal before the Supreme Court of Ghana, the plaintiff, Nana Kofi Antwi V, successfully claimed declaration of title, recovery of possession, damages for trespass, and perpetual injunction over land at Ayensuako. The plaintiff proved sole purchase of the land by his predecessor, Nana Kofi Antwi I (Ofinam), from the Duakwa Stool in 1910 for £465.10, supported by Exhibit A (receipt) and Exhibit B (indenture). The defendants’ claim of joint ownership with Osimpo was rejected due to lack of documentary evidence and factual impossibility (Osimpo died in 1925, after the 1910 sale). The court affirmed the High Court’s jurisdiction, holding the case was fundamentally about land title, not chieftaincy, despite the plaintiff’s status as a chief. The plaintiff also established adverse possession under the Limitation Decree, NRCD 54. The defendants’ appeal was dismissed, with the court upholding the trial court’s verdict in favor of the plaintiff.",
