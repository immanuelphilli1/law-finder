  "caseTitle": "DANIEL SACKEY QUARCOOPOME v SANYO ELECTRIC TRADING & ANOR",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana allowed the appeal filed by Daniel Sackey Quarcoopome against Sanyo Electric Trading & Another, reversing the Court of Appeal's decision that had overturned a High Court award of GHS 350 million in quantum meruit for services rendered as a director from 1974 to 2001. The plaintiff claimed he was orally appointed by the first defendant, a Japanese company, as its representative on the board of the second defendant, Ghana Sanyo Electrical Mfg. Co. Ltd., with remuneration parity. Although Exhibit C indicated his appointment, the court found no evidence of prior written consent or compliance with the company’s regulations under the Companies Code 1963 (Act 179), particularly sections 181 and 272, rendering his appointment invalid. The Court of Appeal had wrongly held that quantum meruit was barred by section 194, which governs director remuneration by shareholder resolution. The Supreme Court clarified that quantum meruit is a common law remedy applicable where no valid contract or statutory appointment exists, especially when services were rendered and accepted. It reinstated the High Court’s award, emphasizing equity and the unjust enrichment of the company.",
