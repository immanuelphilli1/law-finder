  "caseTitle": "REX V NELSON ASIEGBU",
  "summary": "This 1937 West African Court of Appeal decision involved an appeal against conviction on two counts of fraudulent false accounting. The court acknowledged that the counts were duplicitous but found no miscarriage of justice due to the appellant's admission of the acts and representation by counsel at trial. Relying on Section 10(1) of Ordinance No. 47 of 1933 and following the precedent in Rex v. Thompson, the court upheld the convictions and dismissed the appeal, determining that the procedural defect did not prejudice the appellant.",
