  "caseTitle": "REX v AZOIUBE APUOGU",
  "summary": "The four appellants were convicted of the murder of Agwanma Akajuba in the High Court of the Enugu-Onitsha Division and sentenced to death. The principal evidence came from Joseph, who admitted participating in a common plan that included the murder, though he did not physically commit it. The trial judge and the West African Court of Appeal (WACA) held Joseph to be an accomplice requiring corroboration. Corroboration for the first appellant was ample, while for the others it relied primarily on Opara’s testimony that all four accused were seen near the victim’s house on the evening of the murder. Citing R. v. Mullins, the court found this evidence sufficient to corroborate Joseph’s testimony. The appeals were dismissed.",
