  "summary": "The document discusses two key Ghanaian High Court cases, Acquah v. The Republic and Adom v. The Republic, both under the Price Control Decree, 1972 (N.R.C.D. 17), focusing on consumer protection amid widespread shortages and price manipulation. In Acquah, the court upheld a conviction for hoarding rice, interpreting non-display of goods as contributing to public shortage. In Adom, the High Court overturned a conviction for refusing to sell soap, requiring proof that the refusal was at the controlled price. The analysis critiques the latter decision as undermining legislative intent to combat 'kalabule' (profiteering). It also examines the Import and Exports (Special Licence) Regulations, 1980 (L.I. 1248), noting its limited scope and failure to regulate prices effectively, thus failing to alleviate consumer hardship.",
