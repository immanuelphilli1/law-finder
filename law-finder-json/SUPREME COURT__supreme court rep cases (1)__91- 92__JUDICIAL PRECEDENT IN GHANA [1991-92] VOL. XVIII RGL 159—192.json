  "summary": "This scholarly article by Taylor J. N. K. examines the doctrine of judicial precedent in Ghana, tracing its historical development from colonial-era law reporting to the establishment of the Council for Law Reporting in 1971. It highlights the evolution of law reporting through both official and unofficial sources, including early works by John Mensah Sarbah and later series such as the Ghana Law Reports and West African Law Reports. The author distinguishes between the general principle of stare decisis and the formal doctrine of judicial precedent, emphasizing that precedents must establish coherent legal principles rather than isolated rulings. The article underscores the importance of accessible, accurate, and timely publication of judicial decisions for the effective operation of the common law system in Ghana, and notes the influence of English common law, while acknowledging variations in how precedent is treated across jurisdictions.",
