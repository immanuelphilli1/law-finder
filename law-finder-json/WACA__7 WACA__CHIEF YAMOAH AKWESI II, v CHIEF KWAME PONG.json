  "caseTitle": "CHIEF YAMOAH AKWESI II, v CHIEF KWAME PONG",
  "summary": "This case involved a land boundary dispute between Chief Yamoah Akwesi II, Stool Holder of Ayinasu, and Chief Kwame Pong, Stool Holder of Abrakaso, over the Bepoase lands, both under the Ejisu Stool in Ashanti, Ghana. The dispute originated from conflicting executive decisions: the 1902 Armitage Decision, which awarded Bepoase land to Ayinasu, and the 1915 Fuller Decision, which recognized Abrakaso's ownership and established a partial boundary. Although both decisions were validated under Cap. 120 in 1929, a 1930 amicable settlement brokered by Ejisuhene Boaten established that the land be held in common, with proceeds divided equally among Ejisu, Ayinasu, and Abrakaso. The Native Court of Ejisu and later the Chief Commissioner's Court upheld the Fuller Decision, disregarding the 1930 agreement. However, the West Africa Court of Appeal ruled that the 1930 settlement was binding and could coexist with the boundary determination. It affirmed the boundary demarcation by the Chief Commissioner’s Court while upholding the Asantehene’s Court 'A' finding that the land is held in common and revenues shared per the 1930 agreement. The court ordered accurate mapping of the boundary and equal cost-sharing for the survey.",
