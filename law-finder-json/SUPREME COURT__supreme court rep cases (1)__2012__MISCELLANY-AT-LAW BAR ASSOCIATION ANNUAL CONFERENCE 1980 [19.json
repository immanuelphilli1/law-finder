  "caseTitle": "MISCELLANY-AT-LAW BAR ASSOCIATION ANNUAL CONFERENCE 1980 [19",
  "summary": "The Ghana Bar Association, at its 1980 Annual Conference held in Cape Coast, passed several resolutions addressing critical national and humanitarian issues. It urged the government to implement immediate measures to provide water, rehabilitate roads and railways, improve telecommunications, and restore hospital services with adequate drugs and equipment. The Association expressed constitutional concern over the appointment of Members of Parliament to corporate boards, viewing it as a breach of the separation of powers under the 1979 Third Republican Constitution, and called for their removal. Additionally, in light of recent earthquakes in Algeria and Italy, the GBA called on the Ghanaian government to establish an efficient civil defence corps composed of military, police, medical, and civilian personnel trained for emergency rescue operations.",
