  "summary": "This Supreme Court of Ghana ruling addressed a preliminary objection challenging the court's jurisdiction to hear an appeal arising from an election petition. The appellant, Samuel Nyimakan, had been declared unqualified for election as Member of Parliament for Wulensi Constituency by the High Court, a decision upheld by the Court of Appeal. The respondent, Fuseini Zakaria, moved to dismiss the appeal to the Supreme Court, arguing that such constitutional election petitions do not fall within the Supreme Court’s appellate jurisdiction under Article 131(1)(a) of the 1992 Constitution. The Supreme Court rejected this argument, holding that the phrase 'civil or criminal cause or matter' in Article 131(1)(a) includes proceedings like election petitions, which are classified as 'matters' under civil procedure rules. The Court emphasized that the nature of the proceeding—whether civil or criminal in character—determines jurisdiction, not the fact that it involves constitutional interpretation. It further held that the High Court's broad jurisdiction under Article 140(1) encompasses all matters, and the Supreme Court’s appellate role cannot be narrowly construed to exclude constitutional disputes. The motion to dismiss was therefore overruled, affirming the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction to hear the appeal.",

    "The Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over election petitions if they constitute a 'civil cause or matter' under Article 131(1)(a), regardless of their constitutional nature.",
    "The classification of a proceeding as 'constitutional' does not exclude it from being a 'civil cause or matter' within the meaning of the Constitution.",
    "An election petition is a 'matter' as defined under Order 1 Rule 1 of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, not a traditional 'cause' between plaintiff and defendant.",
    "The phrase 'civil or criminal cause or matter' in Article 131(1)(a) is distinct from 'civil and criminal matters' in Article 140(1), indicating a narrower scope for Supreme Court appeals.",
    "The Supreme Court rejected the argument that constitutional matters fall outside its appellate jurisdiction as being inconsistent with the framers' intent and textual interpretation."
