  "caseTitle": "GHANA PORTS & HARBOURS AUTHORITY CAPTAIN ZEIM v NOVA",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana reviewed a civil appeal concerning the beaching of MV Nova VIII by the Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority (GPHA) and its Master, Captain Zeim. The respondent, Nova Complex Ltd, claimed the beaching was negligent or unlawful. The High Court and Court of Appeal found liability, with the latter reducing damages. The Supreme Court held that the Court of Appeal erred in law by inconsistently concluding that the vessel was beached in error despite finding it had listed, which would justify action under GPHA's statutory duty to ensure maritime safety. The core issue—whether the degree of listing necessitated beaching—was not properly addressed. The Court also questioned the evidentiary basis for damage awards, including market value, loss of use, and indemnity for breach of charter. It emphasized that the presumption of regularity in official duties (s 37, Evidence Act) was not validly rebutted. The judgment underscores the need for appellate courts to align findings with pleadings and evidence.",
