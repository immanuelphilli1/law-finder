  "caseTitle": "GBADAGO VERSUS TSILL",
  "summary": "In Gbadago v. Tsill, the plaintiff challenged a written judgment from the Native Appeal Court of Anlo State, arguing that a portion granting the defendant rights over palm trees on Atiavie land was fraudulently inserted after the oral judgment was delivered. The Supreme Court of the Gold Coast, through van Lare J., held that the action was not one to set aside a judgment obtained by fraud—since no fraudulent evidence influenced the court's decision—but rather a claim for rectification based on a failure to accurately record the judgment. The court emphasized that the Registrar’s failure to comply with Regulation 41 of the Native Courts (Colony) Procedure Regulations, No. 10 of 1945, which required the accurate recording of judgments, constituted a violation of a legal right. The court affirmed that the Native Court 'A' had jurisdiction to hear such an action, even if novel, as it applied established legal principles. The appeal was dismissed, upholding the lower court’s order to delete the contested passage.",
