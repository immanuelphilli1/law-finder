  "caseTitle": "MARTIN FUGAH",
  "summary": "In this 1938 West African Court of Appeal decision, Martin Fugah and Kalenu Akoglo, suing on behalf of themselves and as representatives of the Klevie Tribe of Awuna, sought final leave to appeal to the Privy Council. Conditional leave had been granted subject to providing a bond with sureties. However, the appellants, who were illiterate and self-represented, executed the bond in their personal capacities rather than in their representative capacity as required. The court acknowledged the procedural defect but, citing the principle from Kojo Pon v. Atta Fua that substantial justice should prevail over technical irregularities, granted them further time until 28th February 1939 to rectify the error. The motion was adjourned for renewal upon compliance, with costs of five guineas awarded to the respondent.",
