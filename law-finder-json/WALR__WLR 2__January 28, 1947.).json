  "caseTitle": "WILLIAMS VERSUS DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX.",
  "summary": "In Williams v. Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax (1947), the appellant, F. A. Williams, sought to deduct �700 spent on legal fees in litigation over a deceased estate (Taylor v. Essuman and Williams), pending before the Privy Council, from his taxable income for 1945–1946. He argued the expenses were incurred to secure future income and thus deductible under section 10(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, c. 27 of 1943. The Commissioner refused, and the appeal was dismissed. Hooper J. held that the expenses were private in nature and not incurred in the production of income, falling under section 11(a) as non-deductible. The court distinguished between income-producing outgoings and capital investments in property with speculative returns, affirming that no deduction is allowable until income is actually realized, and no statutory basis exists for exempting private legal costs even if linked to potential financial gain.",
