  "caseTitle": "MEND IE UDO AKPAN INYANG",
  "summary": "The appellant, Mendie Udo Akpan Inyang, was convicted of the murders of two women under section 319 of the Criminal Code and sought leave to appeal. The West African Court of Appeal, sitting in Lagos on January 21, 1939, refused the application, deeming the case clear and the conviction valid. However, the court emphasized that while trying an accused for multiple murders in a single trial is not fatal to the conviction, it is procedurally preferable to try an individual for no more than one murder per trial, citing R. v. Davies (26 Cr. App. Rep. 95) as authority.",
