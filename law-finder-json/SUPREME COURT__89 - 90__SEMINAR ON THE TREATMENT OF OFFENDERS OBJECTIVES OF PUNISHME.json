  "caseTitle": "SEMINAR ON THE TREATMENT OF OFFENDERS OBJECTIVES OF PUNISHME",
  "summary": "This legal commentary by A.N. Dokurugu, published in the Review of Ghana Law (1989\u000190), examines the objectives and social functions of punishment within the criminal justice system. The paper analyzes punishment not as an end in itself but as a means to achieve various societal goals, including deterrence, prevention, retribution, expiation, restitution, and reformation. It emphasizes that in an imperfect society, punishment is necessary for the enforcement of laws and the self-defense of the state. The author discusses how deterrence requires penalties to clearly outweigh criminal gains and be perceived as likely. Retribution is framed as society's moral response to crime, while expiation allows offenders to purge guilt. The paper strongly advocates for rehabilitation, highlighting the critical role of social workers in corrections through diagnosis, behavioral intervention, family support, and reintegration planning. It concludes that a balanced punishment system should integrate punitive and reformative objectives to serve both justice and social welfare.",
