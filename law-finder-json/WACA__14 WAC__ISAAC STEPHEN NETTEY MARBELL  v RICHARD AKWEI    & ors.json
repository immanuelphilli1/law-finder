  "caseTitle": "ISAAC STEPHEN NETTEY MARBELL v RICHARD AKWEI & ors",
  "summary": "This 1952 West African Court of Appeal decision in the Gold Coast (now Ghana) involved two consolidated land disputes concerning adjoining plots on Farrar Avenue, Accra. In the second case, Richard Akwei, who had conveyed land to Faris, was estopped from claiming title against Emelia Cofie after having supported Faris' defense in a prior suit where Cofie successfully established superior title. Though not a formal party in that earlier case, Akwei was found to be vitally interested in its outcome, as the validity of his own conveyance was at stake. The court held that by standing by and allowing Faris to litigate on his behalf, Akwei was bound by the judgment. The principle of estoppel by privity of interest was affirmed, citing English and regional precedents. In the first case, Isaac Marbell successfully appealed a lower court ruling, with the appellate court correcting an evidentiary error regarding the proper interpretation of conveyance deeds linked to Vidal James Buckle’s acquisitions.",
