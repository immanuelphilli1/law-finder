  "summary": "In Emelia Morkor Commodore Quaye v. Agricultural Development Bank, the plaintiff sued the bank for general and special damages, alleging breach of duty of care that caused nervous shock and stroke due to unlawful arrest and detention by soldiers allegedly directed by the bank. The High Court entered judgment for the plaintiff after striking out the defendant's pleadings for non-compliance with a document production order, awarding substantial damages. The Court of Appeal found that the trial judge committed a serious procedural error by failing to afford the defendant a second opportunity to comply with Order 31 rule 9 before striking out its defense, thereby causing a substantial miscarriage of justice. The court held that such procedural rules are meant to narrow issues, not to silence litigants, and declared the judgment null and void. The appeal was allowed, and the case was remitted for a proper trial on the pleadings.",
