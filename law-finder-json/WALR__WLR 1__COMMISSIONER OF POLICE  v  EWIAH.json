  "caseTitle": "COMMISSIONER OF POLICE VERSUS EWIAH",
  "summary": "In Commissioner of Police v Ewiah, the Supreme Court of the Gold Coast dismissed an appeal against a Juvenile Court order requiring Alex Ewiah to pay \u00022 monthly per child for the maintenance of his two children, who had been placed under the care of their aunt via a 'fit person' order under the Courts Ordinance, c. 4 of 1951, s. 72(2)(b). The father argued that under native custom, custody and responsibility belonged to the mother, and that since the children were already being cared for, the proceedings were unfounded. The court held that statutory parental duties under s. 72(1)(c) are absolute and not negated by voluntary care from others. It emphasized that the existence of such care actually demonstrates a failure of proper guardianship. The court affirmed that the legislation enhances paternal responsibility, supplementing customary norms. The appeal was dismissed.",
