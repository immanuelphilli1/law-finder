  "caseTitle": "REBECCA NAADU NARTEY v. SOLOMON J. A. NARTEY & 4 OTHERS",
  "summary": "The case involves a dispute over the intestate succession of the estate of the late Moses Tetteh Afutu Nartey, a Ghanaian barrister. The plaintiff, Rebecca Naadu Nartey, filed suit seeking equitable distribution under PNDCL 111, accounting for estate assets, cancellation of improper property transfers, and removal of unauthorized structures. The defendants, including the deceased’s nephew, sister, and children, filed a belated Statement of Defence that the trial court found to disclose no reasonable defence. Despite being granted leave to amend their pleadings, the appellants failed to do so for nearly a year. The trial court entered judgment in default of pleadings and later affirmed it based on evidence led. The Court of Appeal found procedural irregularities, particularly in the trial court hearing evidence before pleadings were complete and without fixing a time for amendment. It held that this violated the audi alteram partem principle of natural justice. Consequently, the Court allowed the appeal, set aside the judgment, and ordered a retrial to ensure fair hearing.",
