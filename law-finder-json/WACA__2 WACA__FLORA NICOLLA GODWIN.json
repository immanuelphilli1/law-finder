  "summary": "This 1934 West African Court of Appeal decision concerned an appeal from a Sierra Leone Supreme Court ruling that dismissed an action for specific performance of a land sale contract. The defendant, an administratrix of her intestate husband's estate, refused to complete the sale, claiming a previously unknown infant grandniece had a beneficial interest in the estate, requiring court consent under Section 24 of the Intestate Estates Ordinance, 1924 (Cap. 104). The appellate court reversed, holding that Section 6 of the Supreme Court Ordinance, 1904 (Cap. 205), did not incorporate the English Administration of Estates Act, 1925, into Sierra Leone law. The court interpreted 'for the time being' as referring to the law in force in England at the Ordinance's commencement in 1904, not future enactments. Thus, the Statute of Distributions of Charles II remained applicable, under which the grandniece had no interest. Consequently, court consent was unnecessary, and the contract was enforceable. The appeal was allowed, with judgment for specific performance, mesne profits of £24, and costs.",

    "The phrase 'for the time being' in Section 6 refers to the law in force in England at the time of the Ordinance's enactment (1904), not future laws.",
    "Section 6 does not incorporate the English Administration of Estates Act, 1925, into Sierra Leone law.",
    "The Intestate Estates Ordinance, 1924, was not repealed by Section 6 and remains in force.",
    "Under the Statute of Distributions of Charles II, the infant grandniece had no beneficial interest in the estate.",
    "Since the grandniece had no interest, court consent under Section 24 was not required for the sale.",
    "The administratrix had legal capacity to enter into the contract without court approval.",
    "It would be inconceivable for the legislature to repeal a major ordinance by implication rather than express language.",
    "The appeal is allowed, granting specific performance, mesne profits of £24, and costs."
