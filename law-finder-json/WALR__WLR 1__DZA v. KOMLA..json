  "caseTitle": "DZA VERSUS KOMLA.",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of the Gold Coast allowed an appeal from a decision of the Asogli Native Court in a land dispute, ordering a trial de novo by a different panel. The court emphasized that Native Courts have a duty to critically assess oral evidence given on oath, including witness demeanour, rather than relying predominantly on a physical view of the land. The judgment criticized the common practice of basing decisions on site inspections without proper evaluation of testimonial credibility. The court held that judgments must explicitly state which evidence is accepted or rejected and why, and that insufficient analysis of oral testimony undermines the integrity of the decision-making process. Costs in the appellate court were disallowed, and costs from the first trial were to abide the result of the retrial.",
