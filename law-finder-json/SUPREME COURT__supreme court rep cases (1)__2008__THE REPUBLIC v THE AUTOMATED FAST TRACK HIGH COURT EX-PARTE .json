  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC v THE AUTOMATED FAST TRACK HIGH COURT EX-PARTE",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana granted an application by State Housing Company Ltd to quash garnishee proceedings initiated by the Automated Fast Track High Court on 24 April 2008 and a subsequent order dated 20 June 2008. The Court held that the garnishee order was a nullity because the applicant, as the judgment debtor, was not served with the order to show cause at least seven days before the hearing, as required by Order 47, Rule 3(1)(b) of the High Court (Civil Procedure) Rules, 2004 (C.I. 47). The Court emphasized that non-compliance with this procedural requirement constituted a jurisdictional defect, rendering the proceedings void. Although the applicant also challenged the judge's capacity after his elevation to the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court based its decision solely on the service defect, rendering the other issues unnecessary to decide. The orders were quashed, effectively halting execution against the applicant's bank account.",
