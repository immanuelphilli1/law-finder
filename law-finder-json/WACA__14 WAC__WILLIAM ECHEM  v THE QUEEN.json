  "caseTitle": "WILLIAM ECHEM v THE QUEEN",
  "summary": "In William Echem v The Queen, the West African Court of Appeal overturned a murder conviction, holding that the appellant, though guilty of the act, was not criminally responsible due to insanity under Section 28 of the Criminal Code. The appellant had struck the deceased with an axe after experiencing a hallucination in which he believed he was defending himself from armed attackers. Medical evidence linked his mental condition to a prior skull fracture sustained in 1943. The trial judge had rejected the insanity defense based on the McNaughton rules, which do not recognize 'uncontrollable impulse.' However, the appellate court ruled that Section 28 of the Criminal Code explicitly allows this defense, distinguishing Ghanaian/Nigerian law from English common law. The court substituted a verdict of 'guilty but insane' and ordered the appellant detained as a criminal lunatic pending the Governor's pleasure.",
