  "caseTitle": "ACHAH v BENDENTU II",
  "summary": "This case involved a boundary dispute between the Stool of Aowin and the Stool of Upper Wassaw over the demarcation between their territories. Aowin claimed the River Tano as the boundary, while Upper Wassaw argued for the River Anwia up to its source, then a bush track to the River Huro. The trial judge and Court of Appeal found in favor of Aowin, holding that the River Tano was the true boundary. An earlier 1925 arbitration award favoring Upper Wassaw was deemed incomplete and unenforceable because the agreement was in English and not properly interpreted to the Omanhene of Aowin, rendering it not binding. The Privy Council upheld the concurrent findings of fact, declined to interfere with evidentiary assessments, and dismissed the appeal. Damages of \u0001100 were awarded for trespass on Aowin land. The decision affirms principles of fair process in arbitration and the primacy of factual findings by lower courts.",
