  "caseTitle": "GERTRUDE SHARON PERLINGER",
  "summary": "This appeal arose from a dispute between Gertrude Sharon Perlinger (respondent) and The Coca Cola Bottling Company (appellant) over the supply of 43 crates of soft drinks, some of which contained foreign particles. The plaintiff, who operated a restaurant, claimed damages after customers reported unwholesome drinks, leading to loss of patronage. The defendant replaced the remaining 23 unsold crates after seven months and offered GHc2,200 in compensation, which was rejected. The trial court awarded GHc18,000 as nominal damages for negligence, despite the plaintiff's claim being grounded in contract. The Court of Appeal held that the case fell under the Sale of Goods Act, 1962 (Act 137), not negligence, as the plaintiff was a buyer, not an injured consumer. The court found no duty of care owed to the plaintiff and no bodily injury, thus reversing the negligence finding. It also ruled that the damages award lacked justification since the defective goods were replaced. The appeal was allowed, and the trial court's judgment set aside.",
