  "summary": "This 2013 Supreme Court of Ghana ruling initially dismissed an application by Abed Nortey (applicant) for an interlocutory injunction pending appeal, on grounds of procedural incompetence. The applicant sought to restrain defendants from dealing with land under dispute while appealing a Court of Appeal decision that overturned a High Court judgment in his favor. The court, per Benin, J.S.C., held that because the record of appeal had not been transmitted to the Supreme Court at the time of filing, the court was not yet seized of the matter under Rule 16(1) of C.I. 16, and thus the applicant should have first filed the interlocutory application at the lower court under Rule 20(2). The application was dismissed with costs of GHC1,000. However, this ruling was later overturned on May 17, 2013, by a panel of three justices following a review application.",
