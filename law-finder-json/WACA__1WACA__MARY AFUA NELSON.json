  "summary": "In this 1932 West African Court of Appeal case from Ghana, the plaintiffs—siblings of the defendant Samuel Quarshie Nelson—sued for an account of estate proceeds following the government's 1923 acquisition of land formerly belonging to their deceased father, George Akotey Nelson. The deceased had made a deathbed request (recognized as 'samansiw' in Ga Customary Law) that the literate defendant manage the estate for his siblings' benefit. However, under Native Customary Law, the head of the family was not the son but the maternal nephew, Acquah, who confirmed the defendant’s caretaker role. The court held that the defendant, acting as a fiduciary and not as head of family, was liable to account for the compensation he claimed and received (£1,650). The appeal was dismissed with costs, affirming the lower tribunals’ rulings that the defendant must render an account to his siblings.",
