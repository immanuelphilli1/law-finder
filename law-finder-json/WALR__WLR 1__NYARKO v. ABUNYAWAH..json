  "summary": "This 1956 Ghanaian land case, Nyarko v. Abunyawah, originated in the Offinsu Native Court and proceeded through the Asantehene's Court 'A' to the Land Court of the Ashanti Judicial Division. The central issues involved the effect of a rehearing order, res judicata claims based on a prior judgment and arbitration, and the improper admission of hearsay evidence by the plaintiff's representative. The Land Court held that although its February 5, 1955, order did not explicitly set aside lower court judgments, it impliedly did so, requiring a full rehearing. The prior 1951 Asantehene's Court decision did not constitute res judicata as it was based on lack of jurisdiction, not merits. The court also ruled that the plaintiff's representative, Kwabena Kyei, improperly gave hearsay evidence as if he were the plaintiff, violating evidentiary rules under Section 20 of the Native Courts (Ashanti) Ordinance, 1951. Consequently, the appeal was allowed, the Asantehene's Court's judgment was set aside, and the plaintiff was non-suited with liberty to bring a fresh action.",
