  "caseTitle": "THE RULE IN ANGU V ATTAH",
  "summary": "This legal commentary critically examines the rule in Angu v Attah, which required customary law in Ghana to be proven as a fact until it achieved judicial notoriety through repeated judicial recognition. The author argues that the 1960 legislative abolition of the rule, driven by nationalist sentiment, misunderstood the rule's purpose: it was not to classify customary law as foreign, but to prescribe an objective method of proof analogous to foreign law. Despite statutory changes under the Courts Act, 1971 (Act 372), the practical need for evidentiary verification remains due to the persistent diversity of Ghana's customary systems. The article demonstrates that courts inconsistently applied the rule even during its enforcement period, sometimes imposing matrilineal succession principles without sufficient local precedent. The author concludes that the abolition has caused distortions in justice administration and that the original rule's methodological rigor remains necessary.",
