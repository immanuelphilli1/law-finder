  "caseTitle": "ROD AMUDZI v. JOHN KWABLATSE AMLI",
  "summary": "This is a civil appeal before the Ghana Court of Appeal concerning a dispute over repayment of a group loan obtained in 1977 by the Atiavi Multi Purpose Co-operative Society from the Agricultural Development Bank (ADB). The appellant, a member of the Society, received 13 million cedis of the 30 million cedis loan but failed to repay the balance of 13,622,489 cedis. The respondent, as president of the Society, sued to recover the debt and damages. The Denu High Court entered judgment for 14,312,391 cedis plus 3.5 million cedis in damages. On appeal, the appellant challenged the respondent's capacity to sue and claimed the judgment was against the weight of evidence. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, holding that the respondent had standing to sue in a representative capacity under the principle in Ghana Muslim Representative Council v. Salifu, especially given the appellant's admissions in pleadings. The court found the appellant's challenge to capacity frivolous and affirmed that the Society had a direct creditor-debtor relationship with the appellant. The appeal was dismissed.",
