  "caseTitle": "ASENSO VERSUS NKYIDWUO",
  "summary": "In Asenso v. Nkyidwuo, the West African Court of Appeal upheld the reallocation of stool land from the defendant to the plaintiff after the defendant, a stranger to the Juaben Stool, refused to enter into a tribute agreement and neglected the land for over ten years. The court found that the defendant's conduct constituted abandonment, justifying forfeiture and re-granting of the land under customary law. It affirmed that Native Courts may admit documentary evidence that materially clarifies disputes, even if inadmissible in higher courts. The appeal was dismissed, affirming the plaintiff's valid customary tenancy.",
