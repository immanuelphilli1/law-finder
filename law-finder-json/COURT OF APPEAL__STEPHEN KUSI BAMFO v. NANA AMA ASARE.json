  "caseTitle": "STEPHEN KUSI BAMFO v. NANA AMA ASARE",
  "summary": "This appeal arose from the High Court's dismissal of the appellant's action for lack of capacity to sue following the closure of a family business premises by the respondent. The appellant claimed succession to a tenancy under his deceased father's will, but the Court of Appeal upheld the lower court's ruling. It held that a statutory tenancy under the Tenants Act, 1963 (Act 220) is a personal right that terminates upon the tenant's death and cannot be bequeathed or transferred by will. Since the appellant’s father died without a subsisting tenancy, there was no right to pass to the appellant, rendering him without legal capacity to sue. The court also rejected arguments based on Order 15 Rules 6 and 16 of L.I. 1129, clarifying these rules govern joinder of parties, not substantive standing. The trial judge did not err in requiring affidavit evidence of capacity at the interlocutory stage, especially where the claim was challenged. The appeal was dismissed, affirming that without a valid legal interest, the appellant could not maintain the action.",
