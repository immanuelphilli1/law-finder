  "caseTitle": "PATRICK BARKERS-WOODE v NANA FITZ",
  "summary": "In this Ghanaian Supreme Court decision, the Plaintiff, Patrick Barkers-Woode, appealed against the Court of Appeal's reversal of the trial judge's findings in a land and construction contract dispute with the Defendant, Nana Fitz. The core issue was whether the appellate court erred in overturning the trial judge's factual determination that the building was not completed as per the contract. The Plaintiff had paid 14 million cedis out of a 17 million cedis agreement for construction on land he claimed to own, with the balance due upon completion. The Defendant claimed the building was complete by 1994 and the Plaintiff defaulted on payment, leading to mutual rescission and partial refund. The trial judge found for the Plaintiff, holding the building was incomplete and the demand for final payment premature. The Court of Appeal reversed this, citing the Plaintiff’s act of installing a caretaker as evidence of completion. The Supreme Court held that the Court of Appeal improperly interfered with the trial judge’s primary findings of fact, which were supported by credible evidence, including testimony from the Plaintiff’s attorney and the caretaker. It emphasized that appellate courts must defer to trial judges on witness credibility and factual assessments unless legal errors or unreasonable conclusions are evident. The Supreme Court restored the trial judge’s decision, affirming that the Defendant failed to prove completion of the building.",
