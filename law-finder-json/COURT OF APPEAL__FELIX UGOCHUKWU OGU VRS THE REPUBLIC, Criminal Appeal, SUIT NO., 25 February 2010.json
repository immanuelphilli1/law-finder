  "caseTitle": "FELIX UGOCHUKWU OGU VRS THE REPUBLIC, Criminal Appeal, SUIT NO., 25 February 2010",
  "summary": "In this criminal appeal, Felix Ugochukwu Ogu, a Nigerian national, appealed against a 15-year sentence for unlawful possession of 878.5 grams of heroin under the Narcotic Drugs (Control, Enforcement and Sanctions) Law, 1990 (PNDCL 236). He sought a reduction in sentence on grounds of harshness, first-offender status, and credit for over four years and five months spent in pre-trial custody. The Court of Appeal acknowledged that the trial court failed to consider the time spent in lawful custody before sentencing, as mandated by Article 14(6) of the 1992 Constitution. While the quantity of drugs justified a severe sentence, the appellant’s first-offender status and the constitutional requirement led the court to reduce the sentence to the statutory minimum of 10 years, with effect from the date of arrest—26th March 2003. The court also ordered his deportation to Nigeria upon completion of the sentence.",
