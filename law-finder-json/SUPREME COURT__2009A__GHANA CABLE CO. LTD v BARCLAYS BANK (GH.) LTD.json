  "caseTitle": "GHANA CABLE CO. LTD v BARCLAYS BANK (GH.) LTD",
  "summary": "In Ghana Cable Co. Ltd v Barclays Bank (Gh.) Ltd, the plaintiff appealed against the Court of Appeal's reversal of a High Court judgment that had favored it on claims for damages due to the bank's refusal to extend further credit facilities. The plaintiff argued it was entitled to continued credit under a 1979 debenture and a 1981 unlimited guarantee, and that a course of dealing created an estoppel. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, holding that the bank retained discretion over credit advances and was not estopped from refusing further loans. The court also rejected claims of wrongful detention of the bill of lading, noting the absence of a clear admission by the bank and insufficient evidence. The judgment emphasized that course of dealing cannot override contractual discretion and that prior credit extensions did not create a binding obligation for future financing.",
