  "caseTitle": "WALLACE-JOHNSON",
  "summary": "The appellant, I.T.A. Wallace-Johnson, appealed his conviction for sedition from the Supreme Court. The West Africa Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, ruling that while the Secretary for Native Affairs' opinion on the article's intent was wrongly admitted, his expert opinion on public reaction was admissible. The court found the erroneous evidence to be of minor importance and not affecting the trial's outcome. The seditious nature of the words was deemed clear, and all elements of the offence were proven. The appeal was dismissed.",
