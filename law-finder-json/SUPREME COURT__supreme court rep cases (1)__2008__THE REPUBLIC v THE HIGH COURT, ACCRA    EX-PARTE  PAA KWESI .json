  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC v THE HIGH COURT, ACCRA EX-PARTE PAA KWESI",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana was called upon to review an application for certiorari to quash an order of the High Court, Accra, which had issued a bench warrant for the arrest of the applicant, Paa Kwesi Yalley, in contempt proceedings. The core issue was whether the High Court had jurisdiction to hear the matter after it was transferred from another judge without the formal authorisation of the Chief Justice under Section 104 of the Courts Act, 1993 (Act 459), as amended. The applicant argued that the transfer was invalid and that the resulting orders were null and void. The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of statutory compliance, particularly Section 104, which reserves the power to transfer cases exclusively to the Chief Justice. It found that the registrar and parties had engaged in forum shopping, undermining judicial integrity. The Court held that no judge or registrar can transfer a case without the Chief Justice's formal order, and any proceedings conducted without such authority lack jurisdiction and are therefore void.",
