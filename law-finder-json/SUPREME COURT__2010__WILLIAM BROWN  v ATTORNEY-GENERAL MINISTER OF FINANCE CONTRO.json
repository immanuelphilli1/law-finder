  "caseTitle": "WILLIAM BROWN v ATTORNEY-GENERAL MINISTER OF FINANCE CONTRO",
  "summary": "In William Brown v. Attorney-General, Minister of Finance, and Controller & Accountant-General (Supreme Court, Ghana, 2010), the plaintiff, a retired Deputy Auditor-General and President of the Audit Service Pensioners Association, challenged executive interference in the financial autonomy of the Ghana Audit Service. He argued that administrative expenses, including salaries, pensions, and gratuities determined by the Audit Service Board in consultation with the Public Services Commission, are constitutionally charged to the Consolidated Fund under Articles 178(1)(a), 179(2)(b), 187(14), 189(2), and 189(3) of the 1992 Constitution and are not subject to parliamentary approval, executive review, or budgetary ceilings. The Supreme Court held that such expenses are not subject to ministerial reduction, parliamentary debate, or approval, affirming the financial independence of the Audit Service. It ruled that the practice of the Minister of Finance reviewing down estimates, imposing budget ceilings, requiring financial clearance for recruitment, and paying pensions through the Social Security Fund instead of the Consolidated Fund was unconstitutional. The Court emphasized that while the executive manages national finances, it cannot override constitutionally mandated charges, and the independence of the Audit Service extends to financial matters essential to its autonomy.",
