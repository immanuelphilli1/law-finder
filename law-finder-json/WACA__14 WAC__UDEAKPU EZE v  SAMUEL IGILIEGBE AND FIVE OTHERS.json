  "caseTitle": "UDEAKPU EZE v SAMUEL IGILIEGBE AND FIVE OTHERS",
  "summary": "In this civil appeal before the West Africa Court of Appeal, the plaintiff (Udeakpu Eze) sued on behalf of the Ihe and Ntugevo quarters of Ezi in Nze, claiming an account of rents collected by the defendant (Samuel IgiliegbE and five others) from Aku tenants on communal farmland during 1947–1949. The defendant argued that each quarter of Nze held land separately and denied communal ownership. The trial judge found for the plaintiffs, holding that the land was owned by the Nze community as a whole under customary law, and the defendant had failed to prove exclusive title. The appellate court upheld this decision, affirming that customary tenure presumes communal ownership and the burden was on the defendant to prove otherwise—an onus he failed to discharge. The appeal was dismissed, and the plaintiffs were awarded £140 12s. 6d., with a quarter (£35) allocated to them.",
