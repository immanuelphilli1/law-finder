  "caseTitle": "THE REPUBLIC v THE AUTOMATED FAST TRACK HIGH COURT EX-PARTE",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of Ghana granted an application by the Republic to quash garnishee proceedings and related orders issued by the Automated Fast Track High Court. The court found that the garnishee order of 24th April 2008 and its subsequent variation on 20th June 2008 were invalid due to non-compliance with Order 47, Rule 3(1)(b) of the High Court Civil Procedure Rules (C.I. 47), which requires service of the order to show cause on the judgment debtor at least seven days before the hearing, unless otherwise directed by the court. Since no such direction was given and service was not effected, the proceedings were deemed a jurisdictional nullity. The court did not rule on whether the trial judge had lost judicial capacity upon elevation to the Court of Appeal, as the procedural defect alone sufficed to invalidate the orders.",
