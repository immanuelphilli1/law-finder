  "caseTitle": "OBLEE VERSUS ARMAH AND AFFIPONG",
  "summary": "In this civil action for declaration of title, damages for trespass, and injunction over stool land in Accra, the plaintiff, a subject of the James Town Stool, claimed a grant of land made approximately 40 years prior, supported by evidence of long possession through farming and building. The defendants asserted later grants from the stool. The court held that hearsay evidence by the plaintiff's son regarding the original grant was inadmissible since the plaintiff could have testified personally. It affirmed that stool subjects generally may occupy vacant stool land without formal consent, except where the land is urban outskirt land ripe for development, which requires an express grant. The court rejected the defendants' claim that building on land granted for farming constituted forfeiture, ruling that use is not restricted by the original purpose. A grant by the stool without the concurrence of an existing occupant is void. Despite prior compulsory acquisition under the Accra Town (Lands) Ordinance, the plaintiff, as lawful occupant who did not claim compensation, retained standing to sue all parties except the government. The claims of the defendants, based on later grants, were dismissed.",
