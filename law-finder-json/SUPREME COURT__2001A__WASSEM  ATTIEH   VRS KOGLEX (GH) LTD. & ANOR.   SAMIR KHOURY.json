  "summary": "This 2002 Supreme Court of Ghana ruling addressed an application for review of a 2001 judgment in the case of Wassem Attieh v. Koglex (Gh) Ltd. & Anor., with Samir Khoury as a co-defendant. The applicants sought review under Rule 54(a) of the Supreme Court Rules 1996 (C.I. 16), citing 'exceptional circumstances' leading to a miscarriage of justice. They argued that the original judgment failed to properly consider the role of co-defendants in the transaction, whether goods were passed to them and payment received from GNTC, and that the co-defendants had admitted receiving plaintiff's goods. The Court rejected the application, holding that the review jurisdiction is not a platform for rearguing appeals or rehearing evidence. It emphasized that no fundamental error occurred, and the issues raised were not exceptional. The Court also clarified that it could not revisit matters concerning the co-defendants' appeal, which had been dismissed by the Court of Appeal in 1996, making those issues non-justiciable in the current appeal. The application for review was dismissed.",
