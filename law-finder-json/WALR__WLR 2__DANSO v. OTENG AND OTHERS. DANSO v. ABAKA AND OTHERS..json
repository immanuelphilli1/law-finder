  "caseTitle": "DANSO VERSUS OTENG AND OTHERS. DANSO",
  "summary": "The case involves two consolidated suits arising from the arrest and prosecution of Twum Danso, a traditional council member and cocoa buyer, by local authority officials in Kukurantumi, Gold Coast. The defendants in the first suit were council officials and police officers who caused Danso's arrest without warrant over a dispute concerning payments for cocoa purchased from stool lands. The Ministry of Local Government had clarified that such proceeds were not 'revenues' under section 74 of the Local Government Ordinance, c. 64 of 1951, but the local council disagreed and demanded payment. After Danso refused, the chairman filed a police complaint alleging misappropriation, leading to his detention on August 25–26, 1953, until he paid the disputed sum. A second arrest followed upon service of the writ, resulting in a charge of attempted theft, conviction in a Native Court, and subsequent quashing on appeal. The plaintiff sued for false imprisonment and malicious prosecution. The West African Court of Appeal held that while the council members could not be directly liable for false imprisonment due to lack of direct influence over police action, the police officers acted unlawfully and without bona fides, using arrest to recover a civil debt. In the second suit, the court ruled that a conviction later quashed does not bar a malicious prosecution claim but increases the plaintiff's burden to prove malice and absence of probable cause, which was satisfied on the facts. The appeal was allowed in part, with liability established against the police officers.",
