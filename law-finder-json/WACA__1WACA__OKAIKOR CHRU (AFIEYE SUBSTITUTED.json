  "caseTitle": "OKAIKOR CHRU (AFIEYE SUBSTITUTED",
  "summary": "This case involved an appeal from a decision by the Provincial Commissioner that had reversed a ruling of the Ga Manche's Tribunal, which itself had overturned a decision of the Asere Manche's Tribunal. The key issue was whether the Provincial Commissioner had jurisdiction to hear the appeal, given that the plaintiff-respondent failed to comply with section 77(2) of the Native Administration Ordinance, which requires payment or deposit of costs before leave to appeal is granted. The West African Court of Appeal held that the failure to meet this condition deprived the Provincial Commissioner of jurisdiction. Consequently, the appeal was dismissed, and the Ga Manche's Tribunal's decision stood in full effect. The court distinguished the case from Kojo Pon v. At/a Fua, noting no discretion exists under the Ordinance to overlook the mandatory cost requirement.",
